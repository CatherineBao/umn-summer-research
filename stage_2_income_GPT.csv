0,upper class,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, a 42-year-old upper class man is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless, enlargement of his scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for an episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition?","This patient's condition appears to be characterized by an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates, suggesting a potential fluid-filled structure within the scrotum. Several years of progressive, painless enlargement coupled with a history of episodic fever suggests a chronic condition, potentially of infectious etiology. Given that this presentation occurs in southeast Asia and includes episodic fever, one plausible diagnosis that fits these criteria is **lymphatic filariasis**, which can lead to hydrocele formation.

Lymphatic filariasis is caused by parasitic nematodes (e.g., *Wuchereria bancrofti*) that are transmitted by mosquito bites. These parasites invade the lymphatic system, leading to lymphatic dysfunction, chronic lymphedema, and sometimes hydrocele formation. The hydrocele can gradually enlarge over time as the lymphatic obstruction worsens.

To summarize, **the underlying mechanism** in this patient’s condition is likely due to **lymphatic obstruction caused by filarial infection**, leading to the chronic accumulation of fluid within the scrotum, which presents as a hydrocele.

### Key Points:
- **Chronic Painless Scrotal Enlargement**: Suggestive of hydrocele.
- **Location (Southeast Asia)**: Endemic area for lymphatic filariasis.
- **History (Episodic Fever)**: Common in filarial infections.
- **Physical Exam (Transillumination)**: Indicative of fluid within the scrotum, consistent with hydrocele.

This leads to the conclusion that the underlying mechanism for this patient’s condition is likely due to lymphatic filariasis causing lymphatic obstruction and subsequent hydrocele formation."
1,middle class,"A 27-year-old middle class G1P1001 is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section. Her surgery was indicated for breech presentation of the infant. She was at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation at the time of delivery. The patient is now complaining of purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding. She also notes difficulty and discomfort with urination. The patient’s prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis, which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. The patient has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, her temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Exam reveals that she is uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Her lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and her uterus is slightly boggy and soft. There is mild tenderness with uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this patient's condition?","Based on the clinical presentation, this patient is showing signs of a postpartum infection, possibly endometritis, which is characterized by fever, uterine tenderness, purulent lochia, and heavy bleeding following a Caesarean section. Endometritis is a common postpartum infection, particularly following a Caesarean delivery.

Given the symptoms and vital signs presented (fever, tachycardia, purulent discharge, and a soft, tender uterus), the best next step in management would be to initiate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. This is critical to control the infection and prevent further complications.

### Recommended Step:
1. **Initiate Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics**: Typically, a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is used for the treatment of postpartum endometritis. 
   
   **Example Regimen:**
   - **Clindamycin**: 900 mg IV every 8 hours
   - **Gentamicin**: 5 mg/kg IV once daily

It is essential to start the antibiotics as soon as possible. Additional diagnostics, such as blood cultures and urine cultures, may also be warranted to rule out other sources of infection, considering her history of pyelonephritis and urinary symptoms.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Assess for Retained Products of Conception**: An ultrasound could be performed to rule out any retained placental tissue, which could be contributing to the heavy bleeding and infection.
- **Monitor Vital Signs and Clinical Status**: Continuously monitor her temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory status to evaluate her response to treatment.

Prompt intervention with antibiotics is crucial for managing postpartum endometritis and preventing severe complications like sepsis."
2,lower class,"A previously healthy 19-year-old lower class man is brought to the emergency department by his girlfriend after briefly losing consciousness. He passed out while moving furniture into her apartment. She said that he was unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness and was not confused. The patient did not have any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. He has had episodes of dizziness when exercising at the gym. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The scenario describes a 19-year-old male who experienced a brief loss of consciousness (syncope) while moving furniture, without preceding chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing, and who has a history of dizziness during exertion. Notably, his vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) are fairly stable when measured both supine and standing, which suggests that orthostatic hypotension is unlikely.

The physical examination findings reveal a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. The disappearance of the murmur with maneuvers that increase venous return (such as leg elevation) is a hallmark finding.

The most likely cause for his presentation, given these physical examination findings, is Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM). HOCM is a genetic disorder characterized by the hypertrophy of the interventricular septum which can obstruct blood flow out of the left ventricle, especially during conditions that decrease preload (such as standing up) or increase contractility (such as exercise). The murmur associated with HOCM is typically a systolic ejection murmur that gets louder with maneuvers like Valsalva or standing (which decrease venous return and ventricular filling) and softer with maneuvers that increase venous return, such as passive leg elevation or squatting. The positional changes and exertional symptoms described are consistent with this condition.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)**."
3,upper class,"A 27-year-old upper class woman presents for a checkup. She is 20 weeks pregnant and has been admitted to the hospital multiple times during her pregnancy for seizures. She has a known seizure disorder but discontinued her valproic acid when she became pregnant. The patient's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. She generally prefers not to take medications and sees a shaman for her care typically. Given her recent hospitalization, the patient agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time?","Based on the information provided, the patient has a seizure disorder and has been experiencing seizures during her pregnancy. She discontinued her valproic acid upon learning of her pregnancy, likely due to concerns about the teratogenicity of this medication. Given her reluctance to take medications and her preference for alternative treatments, it is essential to balance her preferences with the need to manage her seizures for her own safety and that of her fetus.

Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant that is considered a safer alternative to valproic acid for use during pregnancy, although it is not without risk. The potential risks associated with uncontrolled seizures during pregnancy include both maternal and fetal complications.

Therefore, the appropriate treatment for this patient at this time would be:

1. **Starting Carbamazepine**: This is a reasonable choice considering her agreement to this medication after her recent hospitalization. It is essential to monitor her closely for seizure control and any potential side effects.

2. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups and possibly adjustments of dosage depending on her response to the medication and any side effects.

3. **Counseling**: Provide thorough counseling about the importance of continuing her anticonvulsant medication to ensure seizure control, as well as discussing potential but relatively lower risks associated with carbamazepine compared to valproic acid.

The most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time is to initiate **carbamazepine** and ensure close monitoring and follow-up care.

In summary, the plan would be:
- **Start carbamazepine** with appropriate monitoring.
- Regularly monitor and follow up with the patient.
- Provide thorough counseling and support."
4,upper class,"A 45-year-old upper class woman presents to her primary care physician for an annual checkup. She states that she feels well and has no complaints. She lives alone and works as a banker. She smokes 1 cigarette per day and drinks 2 alcoholic beverages per night. She occasionally gets symmetrical pain in her hands where they change from red to white to blue then return to normal again. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and she returns 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in her legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in her extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","The best next step in management for this patient, considering her symptoms and clinical presentation, would be to conduct diagnostic tests to evaluate the cause of her edema and hypertension. Specifically, kidney function tests and cardiac evaluation should be considered, as these can contribute to edema and hypertension. Here's why these tests are important:

1. **Kidney Function Tests (e.g., Serum Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Urinalysis):**
   - Chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury can cause hypertension and edema due to fluid retention.
   - These tests would help assess whether her kidneys are functioning properly.

2. **Cardiac Evaluation (e.g., Echocardiogram, Electrocardiogram):**
   - Cardiac issues such as heart failure can lead to fluid retention and peripheral edema.
   - An echocardiogram would help evaluate her heart's function and structure.

Given this patient's history of significant hypertension (177/118 mmHg), the bilateral edema in extremities, and potential signs of Raynaud's phenomenon (symmetrical pain in hands with color changes), it's crucial to assess her cardiovascular and renal systems comprehensively.

Therefore, the best initial test to perform next would be to start with basic blood work including renal function tests and then proceed with a cardiac evaluation if kidney tests are inconclusive.

**Recommended next steps:**
1. **Basic Blood Tests:**
   - Serum Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Electrolytes.
   - Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Liver Function Tests (LFTs) to rule out other causes of edema.

2. **Cardiac Evaluation:**
   - Initial Electrocardiogram (ECG) to check for any cardiac abnormalities.
   - Consider an Echocardiogram if cardiac causes are suspected based on the ECG or clinical findings.

In summary, the best next step would be to conduct kidney function tests and possibly move towards a cardiac evaluation if needed, to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms."
5,upper class,"A 42-year-old upper class man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. He was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The patient described has systemic sclerosis and is presenting with symptoms and signs suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is a common complication in systemic sclerosis. The chest x-ray findings of enlarged pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border, along with the elevated right ventricular pressures and mean pulmonary artery pressure on cardiac catheterization, are indicative of PAH.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, primarily used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, but it is also used in the management of PAH. The expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in PAH is due to its ability to cause vasodilation and improve blood flow in the pulmonary arteries. This action is mediated through the following mechanism:

- **Inhibition of Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE-5):** Tadalafil inhibits PDE-5, an enzyme found in the pulmonary vasculature that breaks down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
- **Increased cGMP Levels:** By inhibiting PDE-5, tadalafil increases the levels of cGMP in the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arteries.
- **Smooth Muscle Relaxation and Vasodilation:** Elevated levels of cGMP lead to relaxation of the pulmonary vasculature smooth muscle, resulting in vasodilation.
- **Reduced Pulmonary Vascular Resistance:** Vasodilation reduces the resistance in the pulmonary arteries, lowering pulmonary artery pressure and easing the workload on the right ventricle.

Therefore, the action of tadalafil that is most likely to have a beneficial effect in this patient is:

**Inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5), leading to increased levels of cGMP in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in vasodilation and reduced pulmonary artery pressure.**"
6,middle class,"A 17-year-old middle class is brought to his primary care provider by his mother. They are concerned that his acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over the counter products without success. He is otherwise healthy and without complaint. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. He is having trouble with school and has a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, he stands 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members with inflamed pustular acne on his face, shoulders, and chest. He is otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this patient’s clinical features?","The patient's history includes delayed language development, difficulties in school, behavioral issues, considerably taller stature compared to family members, and now worsening acne. These features can be suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome, which is a chromosomal disorder in males characterized by an extra X chromosome. The typical karyotype for Klinefelter syndrome is 47,XXY.

Klinefelter syndrome often goes undiagnosed until adolescence or adulthood and can manifest with various features such as tall stature, learning disabilities, delayed speech and language development, and varying degrees of hypogonadism, which can contribute to issues like acne due to hormonal imbalances.

Given the clinical presentation, the most likely karyotype associated with this patient’s features is:

**47,XXY**

This karyotype would explain the constellation of symptoms including developmental delays, behavioral issues, and significant height compared to his parents."
7,lower class,"A 72-year-old lower class man presents to his primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. He states that his trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. He is able to hear when someone is speaking to him; however, he has difficulty with understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to his current symptoms, he reports a steady ringing in both ears, and at times experiences dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for his father being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally on both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","The patient, a 72-year-old man, presents with progressively worsening hearing loss over several years, difficulty understanding speech especially in noisy environments, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and occasional dizziness. His medical history includes episodes of acute otitis media, and a family history of cholesteatoma. 

The physical examination findings include:
1. **Rinne test**: Air conduction (AC) is greater than bone conduction (BC) in both ears, which is normal.
2. **Weber test**: Sound is heard equally in both ears (no lateralization).

Given these findings and the clinical presentation, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is **presbycusis**.

**Presbycusis** is an age-related hearing loss that affects both ears equally and is typically sensorineural. This condition often presents with difficulty understanding speech (especially with background noise), tinnitus, and sometimes dizziness. The normal results from the Rinne and Weber tests support the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss, as these tests are often normal in such cases.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is:
**A. Presbycusis.**"
8,lower class,"A 68-year-old lower class man presents to the office for his annual physical examination. He has no current complaints. Past medical history is unremarkable. He reports a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is only remarkable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when he coughs. A non-contrast CT scan of his chest is performed, and the doctor informs him that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in his upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised by this news since he has never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs him that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease. The doctor says that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms, which is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this patient?","The concept being described by the doctor in this conversation is the **""natural history of disease.""**

The natural history of disease refers to the progression of a disease process in an individual over time, in the absence of treatment. In the case of lung cancer, this concept explains how the disease develops and progresses over many years, often without symptoms until it reaches a more advanced and potentially less treatable stage. This is why screening is crucial for individuals with risk factors (such as a significant smoking history) even if they do not currently have symptoms, as early detection can lead to more effective management and better outcomes."
9,lower class,"A 24-year-old lower class woman comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. She reports cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. She claims that this is her 5th episode within the past year and is concerned if “there’s something else going on.” Her medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with her albuterol inhaler. Her laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39 %
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","Given the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**.

### Key Points Leading to Diagnosis:

1. **Recurrent Infections**:
    - The patient has had 5 episodes of similar symptoms within the past year. This suggests a pattern of recurrent infections which is a hallmark of immunodeficiency disorders.
    
2. **Symptoms**:
    - The patient has cold-like symptoms that have worsened, including fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. This can indicate recurrent sinopulmonary infections.

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
    - **Immunoglobulin Levels**: The patient has low levels of multiple classes of immunoglobulins:
        - IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
        - IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
        - IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)
    - These reduced immunoglobulin levels point towards a humoral immunodeficiency, which affects the body's ability to produce antibodies to fight infections.

### Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID):

- **Definition**: CVID is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and/or IgM) and an inability to produce adequate specific antibodies. It results in increased susceptibility to infections.
  
- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is typically based on clinical features of recurrent infections and confirmed by laboratory tests showing low immunoglobulin levels. 

- **Management**: Treatment often includes immunoglobulin replacement therapy to reduce the frequency of infections and to maintain overall health.

In conclusion, the combination of recurrent infections and decreased levels of immunoglobulins in the patient's laboratory results strongly suggest a diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)."
10,upper class,"A 33-year-old upper class woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. She feels like she cannot fully empty her bowels. She has no history of serious illness. She has a high-fiber diet. Her father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. She appears well. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The clinical presentation and findings described suggest the diagnosis of **Crohn's disease**.

Here’s a breakdown of the key points leading to this conclusion:
- **Age and Demographics**: The patient is a 33-year-old woman, and Crohn's disease commonly presents in young adults.
- **Symptoms**: She has a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, and significant weight loss (5 kg/4 months). The sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation is also consistent with Crohn's disease.
- **Physical Examination**: Mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant, which aligns with the common site of Crohn's disease (ileum and right colon involvement).
- **Lab Findings**: Anemia (Hemoglobin 10.5 g/dL), elevated white blood cell count (12,000 mm^3), thrombocytosis (platelet count 480,000 mm^3), and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (129 mm/hr) suggest inflammatory activity.
- **Family History**: The fact that her father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent is relevant, as Crohn's disease has a higher prevalence in this population.
- **Imaging**: Barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon, which is a classic finding in Crohn's disease considering its predilection for segmental involvement and 'skip lesions'.

These features collectively point towards Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which can affect any part from the mouth to the anus, but most commonly involves the terminal ileum and proximal colon."
11,lower class,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a 27-year-old lower class man is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm3 in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","In critically ill patients, managing nutrition is a crucial aspect of care to support recovery and maintain metabolic function. After significant trauma and surgery like our patient experienced, early nutritional support can help improve outcomes.

Since the patient is intubated and on a ventilator, enteral nutrition (EN) is preferred over parenteral nutrition (PN) if the gastrointestinal tract is functional. EN is associated with fewer complications, such as infections, and better outcomes.

In this case, the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's nutrition would be initiating enteral nutrition via a nasogastric or nasojejunal tube, provided there are no contraindications (e.g., bowel obstruction, perforation, or severe shock). Enteral nutrition should be started early, within the first 24-48 hours of ICU admission, if possible.

Therefore, the most likely answer to the question is:
**Initiate enteral nutrition.** 

This approach aligns with the guidelines and practices for managing nutrition in critically ill patients who have intact gastrointestinal function but cannot eat orally due to their medical condition."
12,middle class,"A 5-year-old middle class boy with developmental delays presents to his pediatrician’s office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of his knees, elbows, and around his eyelids. The patient’s mother notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since the child was an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the patient’s skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in his sweat and urine. Based on the patient’s symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","Based on the symptoms and history provided, the most appropriate dietary recommendation would be:

**A low phenylalanine diet.**

The patient’s characteristics—particularly the musty odor in sweat and urine, developmental delays, hypopigmentation, and the relapsing-remitting rash—strongly suggest Phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood.

A low phenylalanine diet involves restricting high-protein foods like meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and nuts, while also avoiding aspartame, an artificial sweetener that contains phenylalanine. This dietary modification helps to prevent the neurological damage associated with high levels of phenylalanine.

Key symptoms of PKU include:
- Developmental delays
- Hypopigmentation (due to decreased melanin production, as tyrosine—derived from phenylalanine—is a precursor to melanin)
- A musty/mousy body odor caused by phenylacetic acid
- Eczematous rashes

Therefore, recommending a diet low in phenylalanine is crucial in managing and preventing further complications in children with PKU."
13,upper class,A 70-year-old upper class man presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. He has had hypertension for 20 years and is currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"In a 70-year-old man with a long history of hypertension, the most likely reason for changes in the left ventricle observed on echocardiography is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Long-standing hypertension can lead to increased workload on the heart due to the elevated blood pressure. Over time, this increased workload causes the myocardial fibers in the left ventricle to thicken as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output against the elevated systemic vascular resistance. This thickening of the ventricular wall is what is observed as left ventricular hypertrophy on an echocardiogram.

While multiple factors can contribute to changes in the left ventricle, given the context of chronic hypertension, LVH is the most probable cause. It is essential for this patient to have an optimized treatment plan for hypertension to prevent further cardiovascular complications associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease."
14,lower class,"A 25-year-old lower class construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of his skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. He also complains of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. He is a smoker, but recently has grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis?","The patient presents with jaundice, nausea, loss of appetite, and a distaste for smoking. His viral hepatitis panel shows that he is positive for Anti-HAV IgM, which indicates an acute Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection.

Hepatitis A is typically transmitted via the fecal-oral route. This mode of transmission often occurs through contaminated water or food, or close contact with an infected person. The contamination usually arises in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices.

Given the patient's description and the provided laboratory results, the most common mode of transmission for this patient's diagnosis of acute Hepatitis A is the **fecal-oral route**."
15,middle class,"A 5-year-old middle class boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is home schooled and mom is concerned about her son’s development. He is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on his alphabet."" He always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind.” The patient is observed to be focused on playing with his cars during the interview. Physical examination demonstrate a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The patient's presentation is suggestive of Fragile X syndrome, which is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of developmental delays, poor eye contact, large testicles (macroorchidism), single palmar crease, and a prominent jaw. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder linked to the X chromosome.

The most likely mechanism of this patient's findings is a **trinucleotide repeat expansion**. Specifically, Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of the **CGG triplet repeat** in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene located on the X chromosome. In affected individuals, the number of CGG repeats exceeds 200, which leads to hypermethylation of the FMR1 gene and subsequent silencing of gene expression. This results in the absence or reduction of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is crucial for normal neural development.

Key features of Fragile X syndrome include:
- Developmental delays and intellectual disability
- Speech and language delays
- Behavioral characteristics such as poor eye contact and social withdrawal
- Physical features such as a prominent jaw, macroorchidism, and sometimes a single palmar crease

Given this patient's clinical presentation, running genetic testing for Fragile X syndrome to confirm the diagnosis would be appropriate."
16,middle class,"A 65-year-old middle class man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. He has had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. He has gastritis as well as advanced Parkinson disease and currently lives in an assisted-living community. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. He has a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but has not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. His temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), he is tachycardic and tachypneic and his oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
A x-ray of the chest shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?""","The most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms is likely **his advanced Parkinson disease**.

Patients with Parkinson disease often have difficulty with swallowing and an impaired cough reflex, which can lead to aspiration. The development of foul-smelling sputum and the right upper lobe infiltrate seen on chest x-ray are suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. The long history of alcohol abuse might have also led to diminished gag reflexes and further increased the risk of aspiration, but given the patient's current status and medical conditions, advanced Parkinson disease stands out as the most significant predisposing factor."
17,lower class,A 37-year-old lower class man is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this patient?,"The scenario involves damage to a nerve in the right forearm located between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles, which are anatomical landmarks for the median nerve. The median nerve runs between these muscles and an injury in that area would likely affect this nerve.

Damage to the median nerve typically results in sensory loss over the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger. Therefore, the loss of sensation in this patient is most likely to affect these areas.

In summary, loss of sensation is most likely to occur over the following areas:
- The palmar side of the thumb
- The palmar side of the index finger
- The palmar side of the middle finger
- The lateral half of the palmar side of the ring finger

These areas are innervated by the median nerve."
18,middle class,"A 46-year-old middle class man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, he received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. His blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; his vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration?","This patient's history of a kidney transplant and the use of immunosuppressive medications such as sirolimus and mycophenolate are key considerations in understanding his current condition. His elevated serum creatinine and normocytic, normochromic anemia suggest a decline in renal function. Given that his vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago, the progressive worsening of his condition is an important clue.

The most likely underlying mechanism for the increase in creatinine concentration in this patient is chronic allograft nephropathy. Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is a common cause of late allograft failure and is characterized by a gradual decline in kidney function, often presenting with hypertension, proteinuria, and a progressive rise in serum creatinine. The normocytic, normochromic anemia is also consistent with chronic kidney disease, which can develop as a result of CAN.

Sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) and mycophenolate mofetil are immunosuppressants used to prevent organ rejection, but they can have nephrotoxic effects or contribute to the development of chronic allograft nephropathy over time. These drugs inhibit T and B lymphocyte proliferation, which is critical in preventing rejection, but long-term use can lead to renal fibrosis and loss of renal function.

Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration is chronic damage to the kidney transplant, known as chronic allograft nephropathy.

### Summary
- **Most likely underlying mechanism:** Chronic allograft nephropathy (a result of long-term damage to the transplanted kidney).
- **Key clues:** Kidney transplant history, use of sirolimus and mycophenolate, progressive worsening of renal function, normocytic normochromic anemia, hypertension."
19,upper class,"A 34-year-old upper class female with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, she is started on high dose folate supplementation, and her follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. She is at risk for which long-term complication?","Based on the presented clinical scenario, the patient is at risk for **neurological complications**, especially if the underlying cause of her macrocytic anemia is actually vitamin B12 deficiency rather than folate deficiency. 

Here’s a breakdown of the reasoning:

- The patient presented with macrocytic anemia (elevated MCV of 106 fL) and initial labs suggested folate deficiency.
- She showed improvement in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels after high-dose folate supplementation, and her MCV decreased (to 96 fL), indicating a response to treatment.
- However, this improvement can be misleading if the root cause of the deficiency is actually vitamin B12 deficiency. High-dose folate can improve hematologic parameters but does not address the neurological complications of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage, including:
- Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord,
- Peripheral neuropathy,
- Cognitive impairment, and
- Psychiatric symptoms.

Thus, it’s crucial to differentiate between folate deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with macrocytic anemia to prevent these potentially severe long-term neurological complications. If vitamin B12 deficiency is suspected or has not been ruled out, B12 levels should be checked, and appropriate vitamin B12 supplementation should be started."
