"A 21-year-old woman is brought by her mother to a psychiatrist due to concerns about her behavior. The patient’s mother tells the psychiatrist that she believes that a famous Hollywood celebrity actor loves her and will marry her. When the patient is asked about this, she says that she attended a function at which this actor was the guest of honor six months back, and he waved his hand at her by which she understood that he loves her.
