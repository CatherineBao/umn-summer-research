"A 50-year-old woman comes to the physician because of blisters on her forearm that appeared 3 days ago. She also reports pain in her left cheek when eating and pain during sexual intercourse for the past week. She has not been sick for the past 6 months. She has started hiking in the woods on the weekends with her son a couple months ago but has been careful to avoid poison ivy. She has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. She recently started taking captopril and stopped taking meloxicam 2 weeks ago. She has a family history of pernicious anemia and Graves' disease. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Examination reveals multiple, flaccid blisters on the volar surface of the forearm and ulcers on the buccal, gingival, and vulvar mucosa. The epidermis on the forearm separates when the skin is lightly stroked. The total body surface area involvement of the blisters is estimated to be 10%. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Dissociative fugue disorder,"Hey guys, I am a 50-year-old woman and about 3 days ago, I noticed some blisters popping up on my forearm out of nowhere. I've also been feeling some pain in my left cheek while eating and even during sex these past few days. I do hike in the woods on the weekends for some time now, but had been sure to avoid cattle like poison ivy. I've also been on medication for my high blood pressure and osteoarthritis recently and stopped one 2 weeks ago.

More about my blisters - they are multiple and kind of slack. I also noticed sores in my oral cavity and in other sensitive areas. Interestingly, my skin peeled off slightly when lightly rubbed on my forearm. What also worried me was the fact that nearly 10% of my body is now covered with these blisters. No other noticeable differences in me though. Any ideas on what might be causing all this? Any response would be appreciated!

Note: My family history may be important to consider. We have instances of pernicious anemia and Graves' disease. Any advice/help/suggestions?","I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and while I'm not a doctor, the symptoms you describe could be an indication of several skin conditions. One possibility is a form of autoimmune disorder known as Pemphigus. It's characterized by blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes, often first appearing in the mouth. Given your family history of autoimmune disorders (pernicious anemia and Graves' disease), this might be a point worth considering.

However, it's important to understand that this is just a possible suggestion, given the information provided. It could be several other conditions as well. It seems quite necessary to consult with a healthcare professional about your symptoms as soon as possible. They would be able to provide you with a firm diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. Please don't delay seeking medical assistance.

Let me remind you that stopping your medication for high blood pressure and osteoarthritis can also lead to side effects and possibly manifest in skin-related symptoms. Please discuss this with your doctor too.",Inaccurate,"Based on the provided information, you could be experiencing a condition related to dermatitis or an autoimmune blistering disorder such as Pemphigus Vulgaris or Bullous Pemphigoid, which are rare, chronic conditions that cause blistering eruptions on the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus Vulgaris often first appears in the mouth before progressing to the skin or other mucous membranes. However, these are just possibilities and it's important to note that many skin conditions can present similar symptoms.

The medications you were taking could have potential side effects, but clearly identifying a direct link would require a more detailed medical review. Given that you have recently stopped your anxiety medication, it could be beneficial to be assessed for withdrawal symptoms, though these usually do not include the symptoms you have described.

The recent changes might also be completely unrelated to your previous health conditions. For example, hiking might have exposed you to insects or plants that caused allergic reactions, but this doesn't fully explain the multitude of symptoms.

Regarding your family history, it's important to know that conditions like Pernicious Anemia and Graves' disease can be hereditary. However, your symptoms don't necessarily manifest any of these disease patterns. 

You should get in touch with a healthcare professional as soon as possible to have your condition properly assessed and diagnosed. Make sure to mention all your symptoms, even the ones that may seem unrelated, and your family history of medical illnesses. This will help your healthcare provider make a thorough evaluation.",Inaccurate
"A 32-year-old woman presents to her physician concerned about wet spots on the inside part of her dress shirts, which she thinks it may be coming from one of her breasts. She states that it is painless and that the discharge is usually blood-tinged. She denies any history of malignancy in her family and states that she has been having regular periods since they first started at age 13. She does not have any children. The patient has normal vitals and denies any cough, fever. On exam, there are no palpable masses, and the patient does not have any erythema or induration. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Androgen deprivation therapy,"Has anyone ever experienced having wet spots on their shirt that seem to be coming from one of their breasts? It's been happening to me, it's painless and sometimes looks like it has a bit of blood. I've never had any history of disease in the family, my periods have been regular since they started. Also, I don't have any kids. If it helps, I'm not fighting off any illness currently and I don't feel any specific lumps or notice any redness/swelling. Does anyone know what could cause this?","Let me start by saying that it's important to remember that online advice should never replace consultation with a healthcare professional. That said, you could be experiencing what is called nipple discharge. There are many potential causes for nipple discharge, ranging from benign to serious. 

Benign causes could include minor trauma, infections, or hormonally influenced ductal ectasia. More serious causes could include intraductal papillomas or breast cancer. While it's not common, it is possible for premenopausal women without a history of childbirth to experience nipple discharge. A bit of blood in the discharge can occur in some benign conditions, but it can also be a sign of more serious conditions like a papilloma or even cancer.

It's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider, ideally a breast specialist if available, as your symptoms need medical attention and possibly further diagnostic investigations. 

Don't be overly alarmed as it's not necessarily an indicator of a serious condition, but definitely, don't ignore it. It's essential to get check-ups regularly and discuss any body changes with your doctor to ensure your well-being.",Inaccurate,"While it's important to remember that I'm an AI and can't diagnose medical conditions, I'd like to share that nipple discharge (especially by a one-sided and bloody discharge) is not typically normal outside of pregnancy and breastfeeding. It may occur due to various reasons, such as duct ectasia (a benign condition), intraductal papilloma (non-cancerous growth in milk duct), or possibly, a breast cancer. You've also mentioned a slight change in breast shape and size.

On that account, considering your age and symptoms, it is highly recommended that you see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. They might need to perform a breast exam, and probably order imaging tests like a mammogram or ultrasound, or a nipple discharge exam to identify the cause. As some cases might be associated with breast cancer, early evaluation and diagnosis are critically important.

This doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious - there are many benign conditions that can cause symptoms like this. However, any change in your breast should be investigated by a healthcare professional to rule out any potential diseases.",Inaccurate
"A 59-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening fatigue and a 1-week history of gingival bleeding. He has also had decreased appetite and a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss over the past month. He has tried over-the-counter vitamin supplements with no relief of his symptoms. He appears pale. His temperature 37.8° C (100.0°F), pulse is 72/min and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows numerous petechial lesions over the upper and lower extremities. A bone marrow smear is shown. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?",Nasogastric tube placement and bowel rest,"Hey guys, I'm a 59 year old man and I've been really tired lately and have also noticed some bleeding from my gums for the last week or so. I've been losing my appetite and have lost about 11 pounds in the past month. I've tried taking some vitamins from the drugstore but it's not helping. Plus, I'm looking really pale and have developed tiny red spots all over my arms and legs. Can anyone tell me what might be going on, or what symptoms I could potentially anticipate?","I'm an AI developed by OpenAI, and while I'm not a doctor, your symptoms could potentially align with several conditions. One possibility might be a blood disorder or issues with blood clotting, like leukemia or another form of cancer, as symptoms can include paleness, fatigue, weight loss, bleeding gums, and petechiae (tiny red spots on your skin). However, it could also be as simple as vitamin deficiencies and even some infections.

Given your serious symptoms and weight loss, it's crucial that you seek medical attention immediately. Even though you asked for potential symptoms to anticipate, it's not recommended to delay a visit to a health professional to see if symptoms progress. A healthcare professional would be best suited to get a full history, perform a physical exam, and possibly order lab tests to make an accurate diagnosis and start appropriate treatment.",Inaccurate,"The symptoms you described might be due to various conditions, but some of them suggest an underlying issue with the blood - these issues could range from vitamin deficiencies (like vitamin C or B12 deficiency, even if you have been taking vitamins) to more serious problems such as leukemia, which is a type of blood cancer.

Your symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, pale skin, and red spots (which could be petechiae - small red or purple spots caused by bleeding into the skin), are all symptoms that can be associated with leukemia. This doesn't necessarily mean you have leukemia, but these symptoms are concerning enough that you should definitely see a doctor soon.

Other symptoms of leukemia can include shortness of breath, bruising easily, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen, repeated infections, and bone pain.

Given your age, it's also possible that these symptoms could be related to something else entirely. As we age, it's normal to experience a gradual decrease in energy levels and loss of appetite can occur for a variety of reasons, including stress, medication side effects, and certain health conditions. Regardless, sudden weight loss, fatigue, gum bleeding and the appearance of red spots on the skin are concerning and warrant medical attention as soon as possible.

It's important to make a timely visit to a healthcare professional who can conduct a proper examination and necessary tests to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. They could find something completely different to what you may be suspecting, so it's better to refrain from self-diagnosing. By providing all the details you've indicated in your query to the doctor, it will enable them to get to the bottom of why you're experiencing these symptoms.",Inaccurate
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care clinic for a general checkup. She states she's been a bit more fatigued lately during finals season but is otherwise well. Her mother and sister have hypothyroidism. She denies fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, heavy or irregular menses, or changes in the quality of her hair, skin, or nails. Physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL
Hematocrit: 40%
Leukocyte count: 5,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 188,000/mm^3

Which of the following laboratory values is most likely in this patient?",Anti-dsDNA antibodies,"Hey guys, I'm a 25-year-old female who's been feeling a tad bit more tired lately, especially during my finals season. I don't have any unusual symptoms like weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, heavy periods, or changes in my hair, skin, or nails. Both my mom and sister have hypothyroidism, but I don't know if that's relevant. Feeling really tired isn't typically my thing and it has me a bit worried. Would I likely have abnormal lab values considering my family history during my annual check-up?","Feeling tired can be a symptom of hypothyroidism, but it can also be a normal response to stress, such as during your finals. Given your family history, it is possible that you may be at a risk of developing hypothyroidism. That being said, without any of the common symptoms (like weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, heavy periods, and changes in hair, skin, or nails), it's hard to say for sure.

It's also worth remembering that there are many other conditions that can cause tiredness, such as nutritional deficiencies, sleep disorders, mental health problems (like depression), or other medical issues. 

Your doctor can easily screen you for hypothyroidism with a simple blood test during your annual check-up. The test will measure the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in your blood. High levels of TSH could indicate hypothyroidism.

I would definitely suggest bringing this up with your healthcare provider at your next appointment, so they can assess your symptoms and risk factors more thoroughly and decide what tests need to be done. It's always best to discuss your concerns with your doctor, especially when you have a condition that runs in your family. Peace of mind and early detection are always valuable.

Remember, this advice is meant to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information.",Inaccurate,"Feeling unusually tired could be due to a variety of reasons, including anemia, vitamin deficiency, sleep disorders, or thyroid disease. Since you have mentioned that your mother and sister have hypothyroidism, you may be at a higher risk for the same. However, this does not necessarily mean you have it. With your family history and symptoms of fatigue and difficulty concentrating, it might be wise to discuss with your doctor about getting tested for hypothyroidism during your annual check-up. Depression can also cause fatigue and difficulty concentrating, which you have reported feeling lately. If nothing physical comes up on your lab tests, consider speaking with a professional about it.

Try to make sure you're getting restful sleep and managing stress, especially during finals season, as these can both affect your energy levels. Also, monitor your energy levels and mood after your finals period ends, as high-stress situations can certainly contribute to the symptoms you're feeling.

Remember, even though you have a family history of hypothyroidism and you are feeling more fatigued lately, it doesn't guarantee that you will have abnormal lab values or that you have the same condition. It's important to discuss your symptoms and concerns with a healthcare provider before jumping to any conclusions.

"A 37-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 35 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of continuous, dark, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain for one hour. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. The patient has a history of hypertension and has been noncompliant with her hypertensive regimen. Her medications include methyldopa, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her pulse is 90/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg. The abdomen is tender, and hypertonic contractions can be felt. There is blood on the vulva, the introitus, and on the medial aspect of both thighs. The fetus is in a breech presentation. The fetal heart rate is 180/min with recurrent decelerations.

I'm 35 weeks pregnant and I just had to go to the ER because I've been experiencing on-going, dark vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain for the last hour. My first child was delivered via C-section due to issues with his heart rate, and now I'm scared something might be going wrong this time, too. Adding to my worries, I have a history of high blood pressure and haven't been great about sticking to my treatment plan. I've been on several medications including methyldopa, folic acid, and a multivitamin.

Could all this be endangering my baby?","I'm an AI, not a doctor, but I can share that high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat during pregnancy are medical issues that may require immediate attention. Abdominal pain and dark vaginal bleeding can be signs of complications such as placental abruption. Breech position of the baby may also lead to complications during delivery. It's important to follow the advice of your healthcare provider and stick to your treatment plans. Please continue to closely communicate with your healthcare provider about your symptoms and concerns. They are the most equipped to guide and give answers based on your personal health history.",Inaccurate,"I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and cannot personally evaluate your condition or provide medical treatment, but I can summarize your situation and suggest general advice. You should consult a healthcare professional immediately with these symptoms. 

The symptoms you've described, such as dark vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, high baby's heart rate, and swelling hands could point to serious conditions like placental abruption or preeclampsia, especially considering your history of high blood pressure. Both these conditions can be life-threatening and require immediate intervention. The regular drops in the baby's heart rate and a breech position are also concerning and can need medical intervention.

Please seek immediate medical attention, preferably from an obstetrician or a healthcare provider familiar with high-risk pregnancies. Follow their instructions strictly, take prescribed medications regularly, monitor your blood pressure, and keep them informed about any changes in your situation. Do not resort to self-medication or ignore these symptoms. 

Also, please follow a diet and exercise advised by your healthcare provider to control high blood pressure. Do not miss your scheduled visits, and it may be a good idea to see your healthcare provider more frequently given your condition. Remember, it is absolutely necessary to follow up with your healthcare professional and get treated promptly. The safety of both you and your baby are at stake.",Inaccurate
"A 32-year-old man with a history of alcohol binge drinking and polysubstance use is found down in his hotel room with bottles of alcohol, oxycodone, alprazolam, amphetamine-dextroamphetamine, and tadalafil. When EMS arrives, he appears comatose with pinpoint pupils and oxygen saturation of 80% on room air. He is intubated at the scene and airlifted to the nearest intensive care unit. Body temperature is 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Creatine phosphokinase is 12,000 U/L. MRI of the brain demonstrates extensive infarcts consistent with acute hypoxic ischemic injury. Which of the following is the likely culprit for his overdose?",Ascending loop of Henle,"Hey guys, I've got a friend who's really been partying hard with alcohol and various other substances. The other day he was found passed out in his hotel room surrounded by booze, painkillers, anxiety meds, stimulants, and even some potency drugs. When the paramedics showed up, he seemed comatose and his breathing was really shallow. He was rushed to the ICU. They found that he was hypothermic too. After some tests, they discovered he had some kind of serious brain damage consistent with a lack of oxygen. So here's my question: What type of substance could cause this kind of overdose?","I'm sorry to hear about your friend's situation. It's important to understand that alcohol and medications are substances that, if consumed in large amounts, can depress the central nervous system and cause breathing to slow down. This is known as a respiratory depression. When breathing becomes too shallow or stops, the brain will lack oxygen causing hypoxemia which can result in brain damage.

In your friend's case, it's difficult to pinpoint one substance that caused the overdose. However, the combination of alcohol, painkillers (likely opioids), and anxiety medications (benzodiazepines) are well-known to cause this type of reaction. Stimulants can also put a strain on the body when combined with depressant substances. Potency drugs, depending on their type, can further cause complications or interact poorly with other substances. Importantly, the synergistic effect of multiple substances can significantly elevate the risk and severity of overdose and its subsequent health complications.

A health professional would be most well-equipped to provide a comprehensive understanding of your friend's situation after reviewing his tests, results, and actual substances consumed. Remember that this is a serious situation and it's important that those around your friend understand the dangers of mixing and overusing substances.",Inaccurate,"I'm sorry to hear about your friend's experience. It sounds very concerning. From what you've described, your friend likely experienced a scenario of polydrug use, meaning he consumed multiple substances at the same time. This can be extremely dangerous because the substances can interact in unpredictable and harmful ways. 

Alcohol, painkillers, anxiety meds, stimulants, and potency drugs can all individually cause an overdose, depending on the quantity consumed and individual factors like weight, metabolism, and tolerance. When combined, these substances can significantly depress the central nervous system. This can slow or stop functions such as breathing and heart rate, causing a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) that can lead to brain damage. 

In particular:

1. Alcohol and painkillers (especially opioids) both depress the central nervous system, slowing breathing and potentially causing lethal overdose.
   
2. Anxiety medications, especially benzodiazepines, also depress the central nervous system and can amplify the effects of alcohol and opioids if taken simultaneously.

3. Stimulants (like cocaine or methamphetamine) can put a lot of stress on the heart, especially when combined with alcohol. In large quantities, they can cause heart failure or seizures.

The cold body temperature (hypothermia) could be due to a slowed metabolism from the substance misuse, but that's something that the hospital would need to clarify.

Given the serious nature of this situation, doctors will probably conduct more tests to understand the full extent and cause of your friend's brain damage. It's also recommended he receives substance abuse treatment and counseling upon recovery, as this kind of incident can indicate a serious substance misuse problem, even if it was a one-time event.

I hope your friend recovers soon.",Inaccurate

Your muscles could hurt a lot because they are breaking down faster than your body can repair them. The dark color of urine might come from a protein called myoglobin which releases into your bloodstream during muscle breakdown and ends up getting excreted out.

No need to be embarrassed, getting excessive muscle pain isn't about being out of shape, it could happen due to overexertion or because of some medical conditions.

However, these are just possibilities and it's crucial that you make an appointment with a doctor to discuss these symptoms as soon as possible. They can look into it more thoroughly. Be sure to mention all the symptoms you've mentioned here in full detail and don't downplay anything.

"A 55-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of 5 days of watery diarrhea, fever, and bloating. He has not noticed any blood in his stool. He states that his diet has not changed recently, and his family has been spared from diarrhea symptoms despite eating the same foods that he has been cooking at home. He has no history of recent travel outside the United States. His only medication is high-dose omeprazole, which he has been taking daily for the past few months to alleviate his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Which of the following is the most appropriate initial test to work up this patient’s symptoms?",Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"Hey guys, I've been dealing with a rough week. For the past five days, I've had a fever, felt bloated and been dealing with watery diarrhea - pretty unpleasant. I haven't noticed any blood, thankfully. My diet hasn't changed recently and my family's fine even though we're eating the same home-cooked meals. I haven't traveled outside of the U.S. recently. The only medication I'm on is a high dose of omeprazole daily for my GERD. Any ideas on the best initial test to figure out what's going on?","I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. It's important that you consult with a healthcare professional about your symptoms. However, initially a stool sample may be helpful to understand what's going on. This can be tested for parasites, bacteria or viruses which may be causing your symptoms, especially since your family isn't affected and your diet hasn't changed. It could also reveal whether you have a condition such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). In addition, blood tests or examination of your abdomen might also be necessary. The omeprazole you're taking for GERD may naturally cause side effects like diarrhea and abdominal pain, but a sudden increase in these symptoms would be unusual and should be investigated. Please contact a healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and get appropriate tests.",Inaccurate,"I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Just to clarify, I'm an AI, not a doctor. However, based on the symptoms you've listed (fever, bloating, diarrhea, weight loss, reduced appetite, and stomach discomfort), you may have a gastrointestinal infection, possibly a bacterial, viral, or parasitic one.

Given your omeprazole use, it might be worth looking into Clostridium difficile infection as well, as proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole) can increase the risk of such an infection. This bacterium can cause symptoms similar to what you're describing.

Ultimately, the best initial step would likely be for you to contact a healthcare provider who can evaluate you and possibly order a stool test, as it may be helpful in identifying the cause of your symptoms.

In the meantime, continue to stay well hydrated and rest as much as you can while you're feeling unwell. However, given your weight loss and duration of symptoms, seeking medical advice quickly is strongly advised.

"A father calls the pediatrician because his 7-year-old son began wetting the bed days after the birth of his new born sister. He punished his son for bedwetting but it only made the situation worse. The pediatrician advised him to talk with his son about how he feels, refrain from drinking water near bedtime, and praise his son when he keeps the bed dry. Which of the following best describes the reappearance of bedwetting?",Hepatosplenomegaly,"Hey everyone, I could use some advice. My 7-year-old started wetting the bed again just a few days after his little sister was born. I tried to discipline him for it, but it just seemed to make things worse. A friend suggested that I should talk to him about his feelings, limit his water intake before bed, and praise him when he doesn't wet the bed. Any thoughts on why he might have suddenly started this behavior again?","It's typical for children to regress in behavior during major life changes like the arrival of a new sibling. It's likely your son may be dealing with feelings of insecurity, anxiety, or jealousy, and his bed wetting may be a way to express distress or draw attention. 

Punishing him might actually heighten feelings of insecurity and worsen the behavior. Your best approach is to be supportive and understanding. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Open Communication: Talk to him about the changes at home and his feelings about having a new sibling. Reassure him of your love and presence. 

2. Praise Positive Behavior: Celebrate his successes. Reward him whenever he has a dry night. This will boost his self-esteem and confidence. 

3. Routine: Keep his daily routine as consistent as possible. This may give him a greater sense of control and predictability.

4. Limit liquids before bed: Limit the amount of fluids he drinks before bed and encourage him to use the toilet before sleeping.

5. Medical Check-up: If the problem persists, you may want to have him checked by a doctor to rule out any physical conditions.

Above all, remember to be patient. It's a difficult adjustment period for him. Giving him time and understanding will go a long way.",Inaccurate,"Bedwetting can indeed be a sign of stress or anxiety, especially in children experiencing significant life changes. The arrival of a new sibling is a significant event and could have indirectly triggered your son's bedwetting again. He may be experiencing feelings of insecurity and worry, even though these haven't been openly expressed.

Speaking to him about his feelings could be very beneficial. Try to reassure him that he is still very loved and important within the family, which could help lessen any possible anxiety or stress he's feeling. 

Praising him when he doesn't wet the bed is also a good approach, as this positive reinforcement can help him feel confident and proud of himself. It's essential, however, to ensure that praising him doesn't indirectly pressure or stress him further. 

Regarding his water intake, indeed, it's a good idea to limit the amount of fluids he consumes close to bedtime but ensure he remains hydrated throughout the day. 

The fact that he flinches while urinating and the fact that he's waking up frequently at night to go to the bathroom may suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can cause bedwetting. Symptoms can include pain or discomfort during urination, fever, and frequent urge to urinate. It's best to consult a healthcare professional to have this checked out and treated if needed.

Lastly, never use punishment as a response to bedwetting. It's not something your son can control, and disciplining him for it could lead to feelings of shame, which can even exacerbate the issue.

Take note of his behaviour and emotions over the next few days while implementing some of these suggestions. If the problem continues, consider seeking professional advice, such as a pediatrician or child psychologist. They can provide targeted advice based on their understanding of children and their behaviours.",Inaccurate
"A 21-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a motor vehicle collision. She has significant pain and weakness in her right arm and hand. Physical examination shows multiple ecchymoses and tenderness in the right upper extremity. She is able to make a fist, but there is marked decrease in grip strength. An x-ray of the right upper extremity shows a midshaft humerus fracture. Which of the following structures is most likely injured?",Hyperphosphorylated tau inclusion bodies,"Hey everyone, I got into a car crash and now I'm having a lot of pain and weakness in my right arm and hand. There are a bunch of bruises and it's really tender. I can still make a fist but it feels a lot weaker. Apparently, I have a midshaft fracture in my humerus. What do you guys think might have gotten injured?","I'm an AI and not a doctor, but based on your description, it sounds like you may have suffered from nerve damage in addition to your humerus fracture. The radial nerve can get injured during a midshaft humerus fracture which can cause weakness in your arm and affect your ability to operate your hand. The pain, tenderness, and bruising you're experiencing are likely due to the fracture and possibly soft tissue damage. However, these are just possibilities and it's crucial you consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.",Inaccurate,"Given the information you provided, your symptoms indeed align with a midshaft humerus fracture, which is a break in the upper arm bone. This would explain the pain, bruising, tenderness, and weakness you're experiencing. 

Additionally, the numbness could suggest that the fracture may have caused some damage to the nerves in the area, specifically the radial nerve which is commonly affected in such injuries. The radial nerve influences sensation and muscle movements in the arm, and in case of damage, it could contribute to weakness, numbness, and difficulties in hand movements.

It's crucial that you seek immediate medical attention. Leaving a fracture untreated might cause complications including non-union (failure of the fracture to heal), malunion (the fracture heals in an incorrect position), or radial nerve injury. The treatment may require immobilization and in some cases surgery.

While you mentioned that you are otherwise healthy and don't smoke or have any chronic diseases, which is good to hear as these factors can affect healing, pain management will also be important to discuss with your physician. They may prescribe stronger painkillers, since you're having a severity of 7/10 pain despite over-the-counter medications.

Finally, depending upon the extent and severity of the injury, physiotherapy may be recommended at a later stage to restore strength and function in the arm. In the meantime, try to avoid unnecessary movements or contact that could further aggravate the injury.",Inaccurate

The symptoms you're describing may suggest a condition like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which can cause irregular periods, weight gain, and acne. PCOS is common, but it's crucial to speak with a healthcare provider about it. 

Regarding medications, the ones commonly suggested for this condition include birth control pills to regulate menstrual cycles, Metformin to manage insulin levels, and Spironolactone to help with acne and hair growth. Each person reacts differently to medications, by the way, so what works for someone else might not work for you.

Also, it's important to mention that lifestyle changes are often a significant part of managing PCOS. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management are frequently recommended as part of a treatment approach.

Remember, your healthcare provider is the best source of information for your specific situation, as they have access to your medical history and can tailor suggestions to your unique needs.",Inaccurate,"I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and while I can provide some general advice, it's critical that you consult with your healthcare provider about these concerns. The symptoms you mentioned such as irregular periods, weight gain, severe acne, and unusual hair growth are common in conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a condition often associated with a hormone imbalance that can cause these symptoms.

In terms of treatment, lifestyle modifications are typically first-line treatment. This includes eating a balanced diet with reduced intake of processed foods and sugars and increasing physical activity. 

For the acne, topical treatments can be helpful. These might include things like benzoyl peroxide or retinoids. If those don't work, talk to your doctor about systemic treatments like oral antibiotics, birth control pills (which can also help regulate your menstrual cycle), or medications like spironolactone.

Metformin is an oral medication that is often used to manage PCOS and can help with weight, insulin resistance, and possibly improving menstrual regularity. The use of combined hormonal contraceptives can help regulate your cycle and reduce symptoms as well.

Again, these are possibilities and may not apply to your unique circumstances. Each medication has potential side effects, so it's important to discuss these options and their pros/cons with a healthcare provider. Your care should be individualized based on your goals and health. 

Lastly, addressing the increase in stress with mindfulness or other stress-reducing techniques could be beneficial. If you find your feelings of anxiety to be overwhelming, discussing this with a mental health professional could be very helpful.

The fact that you feel sick might be due to the physical shock related to the injury. It's crucial that you see a healthcare professional immediately. Avoid trying to move or reposition the shoulder yourself as it may cause further damage. You might need to immobilize the shoulder if possible, maybe with a simple sling if you have one handy, but definitely seek immediate medical attention. Take some over-the-counter pain relief medication like ibuprofen if you have it, and it's safe for you to take. Remember, this advice doesn't replace a proper medical evaluation. Please, seek immediate medical help.",Inaccurate,"Given your symptoms - inability to move the shoulder, persistent pain, feelings of sickness, and your arm being rotated outwards and elevated - it's highly likely you've suffered a shoulder dislocation during your fall. This happens when your upper arm bone pops out of the socket that's part of your shoulder blade. The fact that you've had similar incidents while playing football before strengthens this potential diagnosis. 

When the shoulder is dislocated, it can cause nausea and malaise (general unwellness). Furthermore, it can exacerbate the pain significantly, hence your high pain rating score of 7. Also, repeated dislocations or shoulder instability can happen due to structural damage from the first dislocation. There is often a pattern where once you've had one dislocation, there's a significant chance it can happen again.

However, it's crucial to emphasize that I'm not a doctor, but I'm advising based on the details you've given. You should see an actual healthcare professional.

The presence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis could potentially exacerbate or influence some of these symptoms. 

The low level of estradiol, which is a form of estrogen, may suggest decreased ovarian function which is common as women approach menopause. This could potentially cause symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings or discomfort during sex due to vaginal dryness. 

If your headaches cause significant discomfort and are accompanied by nausea, it's important to discuss this with your doctor as well. They could be migraines or related to hormonal levels. 

In terms of next steps, it would be wise to have a detailed discussion with your gynecologist/endocrinologist about your symptoms and concerns.

",Inaccurate,"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to make a definitive diagnosis, but your symptomatic condition where vision loss is sudden but painless and partial, could be due to few conditions. These include, but are not limited to:

1. Optical Neuritis: This condition usually causes pain, but can sometimes be painless.

2. Macular Degeneration: This typically starts with a dark or empty area appearing in the center of vision. However, it usually affects people older than 60.

3. Retinal Detachment: In some cases, it may not always cause flashes or floaters. 

4. Stroke or a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack): Particularly if other symptoms of stroke are present, such as confusion or numbness on one side of the body. Sudden vision loss could be a sign of stroke in the eye, which needs immediate treatment.

5. Glaucoma: An increase in eye pressure can damage the optic nerve, although this generally affects both eyes.

6. Other systemic conditions, like hypertension and diabetes, may also cause changes to vision.

Given your existing conditions (hypertension and angina) it's very important that you seek medical advice as soon as possible. Though non emergency, sudden but painless loss of vision can sometimes be a sign of a serious condition that needs urgent treatment.

He seems pretty tired, irritable, and he's not eating much. To add, he's running a fever of 102.4°F and his heart rate is up. Found out when he was born that he has a mutation in his beta-globin gene which might add up to this. Would any of you know what might be causing this?","I'm really sorry to hear about your child feeling unwell. Based on the symptoms you described: fatigue, irritability, poor appetite, fever, elevated heart rate, and his known mutation in the beta-globin gene, he may be experiencing a sickle-cell crisis which is common in children with this genetic condition (sickle cell disease). The mutation in the beta-globin gene results in abnormal sickle-shaped red blood cells that can block the blood vessels and cause complications like pain, fever and fatigue.

However, please note that this is just a conjecture and should not take the place of a professional medical consultation. Fever can also be associated with many common childhood illnesses such as a viral or bacterial infection. Consulting with a healthcare professional is absolutely critical in this situation. If your child's condition continues to worsen or if he's not starting to feel better after a day or two, you should absolutely seek medical attention. In general, any persisting fever in a young child should be assessed by a healthcare professional as soon as possible. Please take him to a doctor or the nearest emergency room right away. They can assess your son's situation appropriately and provide the necessary treatments.",Inaccurate,"Your son's symptoms are concerning, especially in light of his mutated beta-globin gene, which can indicate a condition like beta-thalassemia, a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. However, his current symptoms could suggest a variety of ailments ranging from a viral or bacterial infection to more complicated issues. Given his persistent fever, the spots on his chest and back, along with bouts of diarrhea, vomiting, and a persistent cough, this could be a sign of a more severe infection or illness.

However, please understand that as an AI, I can't replace a doctor's advice. It's important to seek immediate medical attention given the situation. Prioritize keeping him hydrated and monitor his symptoms and behavior closely. Share all the symptoms and your concerns about his beta-globin mutation with the healthcare provider. They will likely want to do a physical examination and potentially run some tests to identify the cause of your son's illness and develop a suitable treatment plan. 

In case of any noticeable changes in his symptoms, especially in his responsiveness, or any signs of distress like excessive irritability, you should seek emergency medical help. 

Please don't take chances with your child's health. Please seek immediate professional help.",Inaccurate
