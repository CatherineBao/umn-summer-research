This can result in the overexpression of paternally expressed growth-promoting genes.\n\n3. **Gain of Methylation on the Maternal IC1 (H19/IGF2)**: This change disrupts the balance of gene expression by increasing the expression of growth-promoting genes such as IGF2 while reducing the expression of growth-suppressing genes like H19.\n\n4. **Mutations in the CDKN1C Gene**: This gene is involved in regulating cell proliferation. Mutations can reduce its function, leading to uncontrolled growth of cells and tissues.\n\n5. **Chromosomal Abnormalities**: Such as duplications, translocations, or inversions involving chromosome 11p15 which affect the normal regulation of growth-related genes.\n\nThese genetic changes lead to the overexpression of growth-promoting genes and the underexpression of growth-suppressing genes, culminating in the clinical features of BWS, which include overgrowth, abdominal wall defects, macroglossia (large tongue), hemihyperplasia, and an increased risk of developing certain childhood cancers like Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)"

Thanks!', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)","ChatCompletionMessage(content='Earwax, scientifically known as cerumen, is a natural substance produced by glands in the ear canal. It plays several essential roles, including:\n\n1. **Protecting the Ear Canal:** Earwax traps dust, debris, and microorganisms, preventing them from reaching and damaging the eardrum.\n2. **Lubrication:** It keeps the skin in the ear canal from becoming too dry.\n3. **Anti-bacterial Properties:** Earwax has properties that help prevent infections.\n\nTypically, earwax works its way out of the ear naturally through jaw movements like talking and chewing. However, sometimes earwax can build up and cause what is known as earwax impaction or blockage. This can happen due to:\n\n- Overproduction of earwax.\n- Narrowing of the ear canal.\n- Use of cotton swabs or other objects that push wax deeper into the ear canal.\n\n### Symptoms of Earwax Impaction\n\n- Reduced hearing.\n- Earache or a feeling of fullness in the ear.\n- Tinnitus (ringing in the ear).\n- Dizziness.\n- Itchiness in the ear.\n\n### Treatment and Management\n\n- **Home Remedies:** Use of ear drops designed to soften earwax, which may help it work its way out more easily.\n- **Medical Treatment:** If home remedies are ineffective or the impaction is severe, a healthcare provider can remove the wax using irrigation, suction, or manual tools.\n- **Prevention:** Avoid inserting objects like cotton swabs or hairpins into the ear canal, as these can push wax deeper and cause impaction.\n\nIf you suspect you have earwax impaction, itâ€™s best to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)"
