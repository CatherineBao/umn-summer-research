0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, a man is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless, enlargement of his scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for an episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition?","The patient's condition is most likely **lymphatic obstruction**, which can be caused by filariasis, a common cause of chronic painless scrotal swelling in endemic areas of Southeast Asia. 

Filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worms Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi, transmitted by mosquitoes. The chronic infection can lead to lymphatic dysfunction and obstruction, resulting in an accumulation of lymphatic fluid in tissues such as the scrotum, causing the swelling noted on examination.

Key points supporting this diagnosis include:
- Location: Southeast Asia is endemic for filariasis.
- Symptom Duration: The enlargement has been progressive over two years.
- Physical Exam Finding: The swelling transilluminates, indicating fluid accumulation rather than a solid mass.
- Episodic Fever: Reflects possible episodes of acute adenolymphangitis due to filarial infection.

Hence, **lymphatic obstruction due to filariasis** is the most probable mechanism underlying the patient’s painless scrotal enlargement.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,Yes
1,"A G1P1001 is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section. Her surgery was indicated for breech presentation of the infant. She was at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation at the time of delivery. The patient is now complaining of purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding. She also notes difficulty and discomfort with urination. The patient’s prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis, which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. The patient has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, her temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Exam reveals that she is uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Her lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and her uterus is slightly boggy and soft. There is mild tenderness with uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this patient's condition?","Given the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, she appears to be suffering from postpartum endometritis. This condition typically presents with fever, uterine tenderness, and abnormal lochia (which may be purulent or foul-smelling). The patient's recent Cesarean section, persistent heavy bleeding, purulent discharge, and difficulty urinating further support this diagnosis.

The best next step in the management of this patient is to initiate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. The standard treatment regimen includes a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin. This combination provides coverage against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, which are commonly responsible for postpartum endometritis.

Therefore, the best next step in management is:

### Initiate intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin

These antibiotics target the broad range of bacteria responsible for postpartum infections and are crucial for effective treatment.

In summary, this patient shows clear signs of postpartum endometritis, a serious infection that can lead to severe complications if not promptly treated. Intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin are the appropriate therapeutic choice in this context.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy individual is brought to the emergency department by their significant other after briefly losing consciousness. They passed out while moving furniture into her apartment. The significant other noted that the individual was unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness without confusion. The patient did not experience any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. There have been episodes of dizziness during exercise at the gym. Blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur is noted at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The most likely cause of the episode is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the interventricular septum. This can lead to obstruction of blood flow out of the left ventricle (LV), especially during conditions of increased cardiac demand or decreased preload. The signs and symptoms described in the scenario are consistent with HCM:

- **Syncopal Episode**: The brief loss of consciousness while moving furniture can be attributed to a decrease in preload (venous return), exacerbating the LV outflow tract obstruction.
- **Exercise-Related Symptoms**: Dizziness during exercise is also common in patients with HCM due to similar mechanisms.
- **Murmurs**: The systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and apex that disappears with passive leg elevation suggests dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction, which is characteristic of HCM. The murmur gets louder with maneuvers that decrease preload (like standing) and softer with maneuvers that increase preload (like passive leg elevation).

The blood pressure and pulse rate are within normal ranges and show no significant postural changes, which effectively rules out orthostatic hypotension.

Based on the described symptoms, physical findings, and the nature of the murmur, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most likely diagnosis.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"A woman presents for a checkup. She is 20 weeks pregnant and has been admitted to the hospital multiple times during her pregnancy for seizures. She has a known seizure disorder but discontinued her valproic acid when she became pregnant. The patient's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. She generally prefers not to take medications and sees a shaman for her care typically. Given her recent hospitalization, the patient agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time?","In a case where a pregnant woman with a known seizure disorder discontinues her valproic acid due to pregnancy concerns and has been hospitalized multiple times for seizures, managing her condition effectively while minimizing risks to both her and her fetus is crucial. Given her preference for minimal medication use but her willingness to start carbamazepine, it’s important to consider the most appropriate and safe anti-epileptic drug (AED) during pregnancy.

**Carbamazepine is generally considered among the safer AEDs for use in pregnancy**, as it is associated with a lower risk of birth defects compared to valproic acid. However, all AEDs carry some risk, and the benefits of controlling seizures typically outweigh the risks posed by the medications during pregnancy.

**Management approach:** 
1. **Initiate Carbamazepine:** Given the patient's agreement, carbamazepine should be started to control her seizures.
2. **Folic Acid Supplementation:** To minimize the risk of neural tube defects linked to AEDs, the patient should take a higher dose of folic acid (typically 4-5 mg daily) before conception and throughout the pregnancy.
3. **Close Monitoring:** Regular follow-up visits with both her neurologist and obstetrician to monitor serum levels of carbamazepine, ensure seizure control, and any potential side effects. Adjustments in dosage may be required due to physiological changes during pregnancy.
4. **Prenatal Care:** Comprehensive prenatal care, including detailed ultrasound examinations and possibly additional antenatal testing, to monitor fetal development.
5. **Counseling:** Discuss potential risks and benefits of AED use during pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of medication adherence for maternal and fetal health.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time involves starting carbamazepine in conjunction with adequate folic acid supplementation, close monitoring, and comprehensive prenatal care.",Folate,No
4,"A woman presents to her primary care physician for an annual checkup. She states that she feels well and has no complaints. She lives alone and works as a banker. She smokes 1 cigarette per day and drinks 2 alcoholic beverages per night. She occasionally gets symmetrical pain in her hands where they change from red to white to blue then return to normal again. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and she returns 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in her legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in her extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","Given the presented symptoms and physical findings, the woman exhibits some concerning features that warrant further investigation. Specifically, she presented initially with significantly high blood pressure and is now showing signs of bilateral edema in her extremities.

Given her high blood pressure and the new onset of peripheral edema, a possible underlying cause could be heart failure or a renal issue. A structured approach would be needed to evaluate her cardiovascular and renal function.

Thus, the best next step in management would be:

**Order a Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) and a B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) test.**

- **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)**: This will help assess kidney function (through blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels), electrolytes, and glucose levels.
- **B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP):** Elevated BNP levels are indicative of heart failure.

Further steps may include:
- **Echocardiogram:** To evaluate heart function and look for signs of heart failure or other cardiac abnormalities.
- **Urinalysis:** To check for proteinuria or other kidney-related issues.

Additionally, considering her Raynaud's phenomenon (the symmetrical pain and color changes in her hands), evaluating for autoimmune conditions such as systemic sclerosis or other connective tissue diseases would also be prudent if clinically indicated.

Ultimately, a comprehensive approach addressing cardiovascular, renal, and potentially autoimmune evaluation tailored to her clinical presentation is warranted.",Lisinopril,No
5,"A man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. He was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The man described in the scenario has systemic sclerosis and is experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. Given his symptoms, the findings from the chest X-ray, and the elevated right ventricular pressures and mean pulmonary artery pressure observed during cardiac catheterization, it is likely he has developed pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a known complication of systemic sclerosis.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor commonly used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. The expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in this context is most likely due to the following action:

**Increased intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)**

Here's why:

1. **Mechanism of Action**: Tadalafil inhibits PDE-5, an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). By inhibiting PDE-5, tadalafil increases the levels of cGMP within vascular smooth muscle cells.

2. **cGMP Role**: cGMP is a secondary messenger that promotes relaxation and dilation of the vascular smooth muscle. Enhanced cGMP levels lead to vasodilation, particularly in the pulmonary vasculature, reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure.

3. **Outcome**: By reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and decreasing pulmonary artery pressure, tadalafil helps alleviate symptoms of PAH, such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), and prevents further progression of the condition.

Thus, the expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension is due to its action of increasing intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,No
6,"A patient is brought to his primary care provider by his mother. They are concerned that his acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over-the-counter products without success. He is otherwise healthy and without complaint. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. He is having trouble with school and has a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, he stands 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members, with inflamed pustular acne on his face, shoulders, and chest. He is otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this patient’s clinical features?","The patient's clinical features suggest a diagnosis of **47,XXY** karyotype, which is associated with Klinefelter syndrome. 

Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs in males who have an extra X chromosome. Typical features and findings in Klinefelter syndrome can include:
1. Tall stature with long limbs.
2. Developmental delays, particularly language delays.
3. Learning difficulties and problems with school performance.
4. Behavioral issues, such as acting out or misbehavior.
5. Hypogonadism or reduced androgen production, which might contribute to persistent and severe acne due to hormonal imbalances.

Given the clinical presentation of tall stature, delayed milestones, and behavioral issues, a 47,XXY karyotype is the most likely associated with this patient’s features.",47 XYY,No
7,"A man presents to his primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. He states that his trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. He is able to hear when someone is speaking to him; however, he has difficulty with understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to his current symptoms, he reports a steady ringing in both ears, and at times experiences dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for his father being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally on both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech especially in noisy environments, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and occasional dizziness are indicative of a sensorineural hearing loss. The tuning fork tests (Weber and Rinne) performed during the physical exam further support this:

1. **Weber Test:** The tuning fork placed in the middle of the forehead resulted in the sound being heard equally in both ears, which typically suggests either normal hearing or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
   
2. **Rinne Test:** The tuning fork placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process showed air conduction greater than bone conduction (AC > BC), which is a normal result or indicative of sensorineural hearing loss.

Considering these findings along with the background of chronic symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is **Bilateral Age-related Sensorineural Hearing Loss (Presbycusis)**. 

Presbycusis is the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss in adults. It is typically a gradual, progressive decline in hearing ability, more marked in high-frequency sounds and can manifest as difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy environments. Tinnitus and balance issues, like dizziness, are also common features. 

Other causes such as chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma typically lead to conductive hearing loss, which would result in different findings on the Weber and Rinne tests. While medical history includes episodes of otitis media and a family history of cholesteatoma, the tuning fork test results are more consistent with sensorineural rather than conductive hearing loss.

Therefore, the diagnosis that aligns best with the provided clinical information and examination findings is **Bilateral Sensorineural Hearing Loss (Presbycusis)**.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,No
8,"A man presents to the office for his annual physical examination. He has no current complaints. Past medical history is unremarkable. He reports a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is only remarkable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when he coughs. A non-contrast CT scan of his chest is performed, and the doctor informs him that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in his upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised by this news since he has never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs him that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease. The doctor says that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms, which is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this patient?","The concept being described by the doctor to the patient is **lead-time bias**.

**Lead-time bias** occurs in the context of screening for diseases such as cancer. It refers to the phenomenon where early detection of a disease (through screening) increases the perceived duration of survival without actually affecting the course of the disease. This can give the false impression that early detection leads to better outcomes, simply because the disease was identified earlier in its natural history. 

In this case, the doctor is explaining to the patient that lung cancers often do not present with symptoms until they are quite advanced. Early screening, especially in high-risk individuals like long-term smokers, aims to detect cancer at an earlier stage when it is asymptomatic, which can potentially lead to earlier intervention and better prognoses. However, this earlier detection also means that the period between diagnosis and eventual outcome is longer, which can be confused with improved survival if not properly accounted for in survival statistics.",Latent period,No
9,"A woman comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. She reports cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. She claims that this is her 5th episode within the past year and is concerned if “there’s something else going on.” Her medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with her albuterol inhaler. Her laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39 %
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are indicative of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). CVID is characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM) and an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

Here is a summary of the findings supporting this diagnosis:
- **History of Recurrent Infections:** The patient reports multiple episodes of sinus infections (5 times in the past year), along with current symptoms of sinus headache, congestion, and cough.
- **Low Immunoglobulin Levels:** The patient's lab results show low levels of IgA (54 mg/dL), IgG (470 mg/dL), and IgM (29 mg/dL), all of which are below the normal range.
- **Normal Complete Blood Count (CBC):** The patient's hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, and platelet count are within the normal range, suggesting that other potential causes of her symptoms (such as a primary hematologic disorder) are less likely.

Given the combination of recurrent infections and low immunoglobulin levels, Common Variable Immunodeficiency is the most likely diagnosis. It would be important to refer the patient to an immunologist for further evaluation and management, which may include immunoglobulin replacement therapy and potentially other treatments to prevent future infections.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"A woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. She feels like she cannot fully empty her bowels. She has no history of serious illness. She has a high-fiber diet. Her father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. She appears well. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient presents with a prolonged history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, and significant weight loss. Additionally, her physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and her laboratory findings include anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Taking these findings into account, the most likely diagnosis is **Crohn's disease**.

Here's a breakdown of the supportive findings:

1. **Symptoms**: Intermittent cramping, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, and weight loss are common in Crohn's disease.
2. **Right lower quadrant tenderness**: This often indicates disease involvement of the terminal ileum and/or right colon, common sites for Crohn's.
3. **Negative stool occult blood**: While bleeding can occur in Crohn's disease, it is not always present.
4. **Anemia**: Often associated with chronic disease and potential malabsorption.
5. **Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis**: Elevated white blood cell and platelet counts can reflect the chronic inflammatory state.
6. **Elevated ESR**: Indicates ongoing inflammation.
7. **Radiographic findings**: The ulceration and narrowing seen on the barium enema are typical for Crohn's disease, which can cause strictures and transmural inflammation.

Additionally, the patient's high-fiber diet and absence of a prior serious illness do not contradict this diagnosis, and the elevated inflammatory markers (ESR) along with her familial background (Ashkenazi Jewish descent) further support the likelihood of Crohn's disease, as this population has a higher prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and supportive findings is **Crohn's disease**.",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a patient is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm³ in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","In critically ill patients, especially those requiring a prolonged ICU stay, such as this patient recovering from a severe head injury and surgery, appropriate nutritional support is crucial. The best approach to providing nutrition in this case is typically early enteral nutrition, which is usually initiated within 24-48 hours after admission, provided that the patient is hemodynamically stable and has a functioning gastrointestinal tract.

The physiological rationale behind early enteral nutrition includes the maintenance of gut integrity, prevention of bacterial translocation, and modulation of the immune response. It has been shown to be associated with better outcomes compared to parenteral nutrition, including decreased rates of infection, shorter ICU stays, and improved overall recovery.

Given that the patient is already on a ventilator, enteral nutrition can potentially be administered via a nasogastric or nasojejunal tube, if there are no contraindications such as significant gastrointestinal bleeding, obstructions, or severe ileus.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition, in addition to intravenous fluids, is to **initiate enteral nutrition** as soon as feasible. If enteral nutrition is not possible due to gastrointestinal contraindications, parenteral nutrition might be considered, but it is generally not the first choice.

### Summary:
- **Next Step:** Initiate enteral nutrition.
- **Why:** Early enteral nutrition supports gut integrity, reduces infection risk, and provides better outcomes.
- **Alternative (if enteral is not feasible):** Consider parenteral nutrition.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"A boy with developmental delays presents to his pediatrician’s office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of his knees, elbows, and around his eyelids. The patient’s mother notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since the child was an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the patient’s skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in his sweat and urine. Based on the patient’s symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","The boy's presentation is suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This deficiency leads to elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood, which can cause neurotoxicity and developmental delays.

The key clinical features supporting the diagnosis of PKU include:
- Developmental delays
- Hypopigmentation of skin and hair (due to impaired melanin synthesis)
- A musty odor (due to phenylacetate in sweat and urine)
- Eczema or an ‘itchy rash’ with a relapsing-remitting course

Considering this diagnosis, the most appropriate dietary recommendation would be a **low-phenylalanine diet**. This involves limiting foods high in phenylalanine (including many proteins like meat, dairy, nuts, and soy) and usually utilizing a special medical formula that provides essential amino acids without phenylalanine.

Thus, the dietary recommendation for this patient would be:

**""Restrict phenylalanine intake.""**

This diet helps in managing PKU by keeping phenylalanine levels in the blood within a safe range, thereby preventing the neurotoxic effects and improving or stabilizing developmental outcomes.",Avoid meat,No
13,A man presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. He has had hypertension for 20 years and is currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. His blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"Given the patient's long history of hypertension and the current elevated blood pressure of 150/100 mm Hg, it is likely that the changes observed in the left ventricle on echocardiography are due to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Hypertension is a major risk factor for LVH, a condition where the muscle wall of the heart's left ventricle thickens in response to increased workload and pressure. Over time, chronic high blood pressure forces the heart to work harder to pump blood against the increased resistance, leading to hypertrophy of the left ventricular muscle. This is a compensatory mechanism to maintain adequate cardiac output, but it can lead to various complications if not properly managed. Therefore, the most likely reason for the changes seen in the left ventricle is hypertensive-related left ventricular hypertrophy.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"A construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of his skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. He also complains of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. He is a smoker, but recently has grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis?","The patient's diagnosis, based on the positive Anti-HAV IgM, is hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. This indicates an acute hepatitis A infection. The most common mode of transmission for hepatitis A is the fecal-oral route. This can occur through:

1. Consumption of contaminated food or water.
2. Close personal contact with an infected person.
3. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices.

Given that the patient is a construction worker, it's possible that he could have been exposed to contaminated food or water at work or through other routes consistent with fecal-oral transmission. This transmission route is typical for hepatitis A, especially in areas with inadequate sanitation control.",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"A boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is home schooled and mom is concerned about her son’s development. He is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on his alphabet."" He always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind.” The patient is observed to be focused on playing with his cars during the interview. Physical examination demonstrates a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The clinical presentation described — a child who is developmentally delayed, has poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles — is suggestive of Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and is associated with a specific genetic mutation.

The most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings is an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. Normally, the FMR1 gene contains up to 44 CGG repeats, but in individuals with Fragile X syndrome, the number of these repeats is significantly expanded (typically more than 200 repeats). This expansion leads to methylation of the FMR1 gene, which in turn silences the gene and reduces the production of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a protein necessary for normal neural development.

Key features of Fragile X syndrome include:
1. Developmental delay and intellectual disability.
2. Poor eye contact and social disinterest can indicate issues with social interaction, which are commonly seen in Fragile X syndrome.
3. Physical features such as a prominent jaw and large ears.
4. A single palmar crease.
5. Macroorchidism (enlarged testicles) which becomes more noticeable after puberty.

Based on these findings, genetic testing for the CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene should be conducted to confirm the diagnosis.",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"A man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. He has had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. He has gastritis as well as advanced Parkinson's disease and currently lives in an assisted-living community. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. He has a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but has not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. His temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), he is tachycardic and tachypneic and his oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
A chest x-ray shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?""","The patient's clinical presentation suggests an aspiration pneumonia, which is characterized by a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, shortness of breath, fever, and findings on the chest x-ray indicative of pneumonia in the right upper lobe. Aspiration pneumonia is particularly common in individuals with certain risk factors.

In this case, the most significant predisposing factor is his advanced Parkinson's disease. Parkinson’s disease can impair swallowing and coughing mechanisms, increasing the risk for aspiration of oropharyngeal contents into the lungs. This is due to the dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) commonly associated with Parkinson’s disease.

His history of alcohol abuse and smoking, although contributing factors to pulmonary pathology, are less directly related to the acute risk of aspiration pneumonia compared to the effects of Parkinson’s disease on his swallowing function.

Key points supporting this conclusion include:

1. **Swallowing Dysfunction:** Parkinson's disease often leads to dysphagia.
2. **Cough Reflex Impairment:** Patients with Parkinson’s disease can have a diminished ability to clear their airways effectively.
3. **Foul-Smelling Sputum:** Indicates anaerobic bacterial infection, more common in aspiration pneumonia.

In conclusion, the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms is his advanced **Parkinson's disease**.","Parkinson disease

17,A man is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this patient?,"The nerve damaged in this patient is likely the median nerve, which runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles in the forearm. Damage to the median nerve can lead to loss of sensation in specific areas of the hand.

The areas most likely to lose sensation due to damage to the median nerve are:
1. The lateral three and a half fingers (the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger) on the palmar side.
2. The distal parts of these fingers on the dorsal side.

So, in this case, loss of sensation over the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and lateral half of the ring finger is most likely.",Fingertip of the index finger,Yes
18,"A man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, he received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. His blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; his vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration?","The patient presents with progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite, along with normocytic, normochromic anemia and an elevated serum creatinine concentration, which has risen from normal levels measured 6 months ago. Given the patient's history of a kidney transplant and current immunosuppressive therapy with sirolimus and mycophenolate, the most likely underlying mechanism for the increase in creatinine concentration is **chronic allograft nephropathy**.

Rising serum creatinine in a renal transplant recipient usually raises concern for graft dysfunction. Common causes of graft dysfunction include:

1. **Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN)**: This refers to a gradual decline in kidney function and is a common cause of late graft failure. The condition is often associated with fibrosis and scarring in the transplanted kidney, which can be due to a combination of chronic rejection, nephrotoxic effects of immunosuppressive drugs, and other non-immune injury.

2. **Drug Toxicity**: While sirolimus and mycophenolate are used to prevent rejection, they can sometimes contribute to renal dysfunction. However, drug-induced nephrotoxicity typically presents with different features and would commonly affect liver function tests and white blood cell counts.

Given the information, the onset of new symptoms of fatigue and loss of appetite, along with signs of kidney dysfunction (elevated creatinine) in a patient with a history of a kidney transplant, points towards chronic allograft nephropathy as the most likely cause.

Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of the patient's increase in creatinine concentration is:
- **Chronic allograft nephropathy**.",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,No
19,"A female with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, she is started on high dose folate supplementation, and her follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. She is at risk for which long-term complication?","In this scenario, the patient's initial lab results showing a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL suggest a macrocytic anemia, which may be related to a deficiency in folate or vitamin B12. The improvement in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and decrease in MCV after folate supplementation indicates that the folate deficiency was at least partly responsible for her anemia.

However, a gastric sleeve operation can also predispose patients to vitamin B12 deficiency due to decreased production of intrinsic factor and reduced absorption in the modified gastrointestinal tract. While the folate supplementation may correct the folate deficiency and improve the hematological parameters, it will not address a concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency.

If vitamin B12 deficiency is present and remains untreated, the patient is at long-term risk for **neurological complications**, which can include:

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Tingling, numbness, and weakness in the hands and feet.
- **Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord**: This involves demyelination of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts, leading to impaired proprioception and vibration sense, ataxia, and spasticity.
- **Cognitive changes**: Memory impairment, confusion, or even dementia.
- **Mood changes**: Depression or irritability.

Therefore, it is critical to assess and monitor vitamin B12 levels in patients who have undergone gastric sleeve surgery, especially when macrocytic anemia is detected, to prevent these potentially serious long-term complications.",Peripheral neuropathy,Yes
