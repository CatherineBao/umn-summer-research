0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, a 42-year-old Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless, enlargement of the scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for an episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this person's condition?","The clinical presentation described suggests a condition with a significant and clear underlying mechanism. Given the long history, progressive, painless enlargement of the scrotum and the fact that the enlarged hemiscrotum transilluminates, along with a background of episodic fever, one significant possibility is **filariasis**, particularly **lymphatic filariasis** caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or Brugia timori.

1. **Pathogenesis**: Lymphatic filariasis is caused by parasitic worms transmitted by mosquito bites. The lymphatic system becomes infected by these parasites, leading to lymphatic dysfunction. This can cause chronic lymphatic obstruction, leading to the accumulation of lymphatic fluid (lymph) in the scrotum.

2. **Chronic Lymphedema**: Over time, the obstructed lymphatic vessels lead to the painless, progressive enlargement of tissues, including the scrotum, as described in the patient's history. The transillumination of the enlarged hemiscrotum suggests that the swelling is due to the presence of fluid, consistent with the condition known as **hydrocele**, which is commonly associated with lymphatic filariasis.

3. **Episodic Fever**: The episodic fever episodes could be related to acute inflammatory responses triggered by the death of the adult worms or secondary bacterial infections.

Therefore, in the context of a humanitarian mission in Southeast Asia, a region where filariasis is endemic, the most appropriate underlying mechanism for this individual's symptoms is the **infection and subsequent lymphatic obstruction caused by parasitic worms**, leading to chronic lymphedema and hydrocele formation.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,Yes
1,"A 27-year-old Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individual, G1P1001, is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section. The surgery was indicated for breech presentation of the infant. The individual was at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation at the time of delivery. They are now complaining of purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding. They also note difficulty and discomfort with urination. The individual's prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis, which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. They have a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, their temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Exam reveals that they are uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Their lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and their uterus is slightly boggy and soft. There is mild tenderness with uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this individual's condition?","The individual described is exhibiting signs and symptoms suggestive of a postpartum infection, likely endometritis, given the purulent discharge, continued heavy bleeding, and fever. Endometritis is a common postpartum complication, especially following a Caesarean section, and it can be associated with polymicrobial infection.

The best next step in management for this patient is to initiate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. This approach is critical to cover the most likely pathogens, which include aerobes and anaerobes (such as gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes).

The recommended regimen typically includes:
- Clindamycin plus gentamicin
OR
- Ampicillin-sulbactam if the patient has contraindications to or adverse effects from the above regimen.

Given this patient’s presentation of fever, tachycardia, purulent lochia, and a boggy uterus, alongside their recent Caesarean section, these clinical features strongly indicate a diagnosis of postpartum endometritis.

Thus, the best next step in management for this patient is:

**Initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, such as clindamycin and gentamicin.**

This treatment should be started as soon as possible to manage the infection and prevent potential complications. Further diagnostic workup, such as cultures, can be done, but antibiotic therapy should not be delayed while awaiting results.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy 19-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native individual is brought to the emergency department by their partner after briefly losing consciousness. They passed out while moving furniture into the partner's apartment. The partner reported that the individual was unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness and was not confused. The individual did not have any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. They have had episodes of dizziness when exercising at the gym. Their blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The described symptoms and examination findings in this 19-year-old individual suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as the most likely cause of the syncope. HCM is a genetic condition often associated with mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, and it can be more prevalent among certain ethnic groups, including American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Key points supporting HCM in this case include:

1. **Syncope and Exercise Intolerance:** The syncope that occurred during physical exertion (moving furniture) and episodes of dizziness at the gym are consistent with HCM, where physical strain can exacerbate outflow obstruction.

2. **Characteristic Murmur:** The systolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border and apex, which disappears with passive leg elevation, is classic for HCM. In HCM, the murmur increases with maneuvers that decrease preload (such as standing or Valsalva maneuver) and decreases with maneuvers that increase preload or afterload (like squatting or passive leg elevation).

3. **Vital Signs:** The relatively stable blood pressure and pulse rate changes upon standing argue against orthostatic hypotension or significant autonomic dysfunction.

4. **Absence of Other Symptoms:** Lack of chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea reduces the likelihood of acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or pulmonary causes.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should prompt further evaluation, including an echocardiogram, to assess the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, any outflow tract obstruction, and to evaluate for other potential complications of HCM (e.g., mitral regurgitation, myocardial fibrosis). It is crucial for individuals with HCM to receive appropriate management to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac events, especially during physical activity.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"A 27-year-old Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individual presents for a checkup. They are 20 weeks pregnant and have been admitted to the hospital multiple times during the pregnancy for seizures. They have a known seizure disorder but discontinued their valproic acid when they became pregnant. The individual's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. They do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. They generally prefer not to take medications and see a shaman for their care typically. Given their recent hospitalization, the individual agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this individual at this time?","The management of seizures during pregnancy is complex due to the need to balance the health of the mother and the potential risks to the fetus. The individual in this case has a known seizure disorder and has experienced multiple seizures during the pregnancy, indicating the need for effective seizure management.

Valproic acid was discontinued due to its known teratogenic effects, which can lead to neural tube defects and other congenital malformations. While carbamazepine is a safer alternative in pregnancy compared to valproic acid, it is not completely without risks and requires careful monitoring.

Given the scenario, the appropriate steps to manage this individual’s condition effectively would include:

1. **Initiate carbamazepine**: Carbamazepine can be a reasonable choice for seizure control during pregnancy. It is generally considered to pose less risk compared to valproic acid. However, it's important to be aware that carbamazepine is also associated with some teratogenic risks.

2. **Clinical monitoring and titration**: Initiate carbamazepine at a lower dose and titrate as needed to achieve effective seizure control while minimizing the dose. Frequent monitoring of serum levels may be necessary.

3. **Folic acid supplementation**: Prescribe high-dose folic acid (at least 4 mg daily) throughout the pregnancy as it can help reduce the risk of neural tube defects, especially when using anticonvulsants.

4. **Regular follow-up and collaboration**: Ensure regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider familiar with managing epilepsy in pregnancy. Collaboration with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist may be beneficial.

5. **Non-pharmacological support**: Respect the individual’s use of a shaman for their care and try to incorporate this preference into the overall treatment plan while educating about the importance of controlling seizures for the safety of both mother and baby.

6. **Patient education and counseling**: Educate the patient regarding the potential risks and benefits of the anticonvulsant therapy during pregnancy and the importance of adherence to the prescribed treatment.

Thus, the most appropriate treatment for this individual at this time would be to initiate carbamazepine, ensure regular monitoring and follow-up, supplement with high-dose folic acid, and incorporate comprehensive patient education and respect for cultural preferences into the treatment plan.",Folate,Yes
4,"A 45-year-old White person presents to their primary care physician for an annual checkup. They state that they feel well and have no complaints. They live alone and work as a banker. They smoke 1 cigarette per day and drink 2 alcoholic beverages per night. They occasionally get symmetrical pain in their hands where the hands change from red to white to blue then return to normal again. Their temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and they return 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in their legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in their extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","The initial findings and subsequent symptoms of weight gain in the legs and arms accompanied by bilateral edema after starting hypertension treatment are concerning and warrant a thorough investigation.

Given the bilateral edema, it raises the possibility of secondary effects from the antihypertensive medication or an underlying condition such as renal, cardiac, or liver disease.

1. **Medication Review:**
   - Check the type of antihypertensive medication that was started. Certain medications, such as calcium channel blockers, can cause peripheral edema.

2. **Diagnostic Workup:**
   - **Blood Tests:**
     - Electrolytes, kidney function (serum creatinine, BUN), liver function tests, and serum albumin to evaluate organ function and rule out systemic causes.
   - **Urinalysis:**
     - To check for proteinuria or other signs of renal disease that could be contributing to the edema.
   - **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**
     - To evaluate cardiac function and look for signs of heart failure or other cardiac conditions that could cause edema.
   - **Echocardiogram:**
     - If cardiac etiology is suspected.

3. **Consider Changing Medication:**
   - If the edema is related to the antihypertensive medication (e.g., a calcium channel blocker), consider switching to a different class of antihypertensive drugs.

Based on the initial presentation and the subsequent development of edema, the best next step in management is:

**Reevaluate the patient's antihypertensive medication and perform blood tests, urinalysis, and an ECG.**

This comprehensive approach aims to identify the exact cause of the edema and address it appropriately, either by changing medication or by treating an underlying condition.",Lisinopril,No
5,"A 42-year-old White individual comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. This person was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The patient in question has systemic sclerosis and presents with symptoms and findings indicative of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as evidenced by elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular pressures. Given the initiation of tadalafil as a treatment, it's important to understand its mechanism of action for PAH.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, which works by inhibiting the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The accumulation of cGMP in the pulmonary vasculature leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle cells through the nitric oxide pathway. This results in vasodilation of the pulmonary arteries, reduces pulmonary vascular resistance, and decreases pulmonary artery pressures.

Thus, the expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in this patient is most likely due to:

**Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme.**

The inhibition of this enzyme leads to increased levels of cGMP, promoting vasodilation and consequently reducing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which helps alleviate symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,No
6,"A 17-year-old Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander is brought to their primary care provider by their parent. They are concerned that the teenager’s acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over-the-counter products without success. The individual is otherwise healthy and without complaint. They were born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. They are up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. The teenager is having trouble with school and has a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, they stand 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members, with inflamed pustular acne on their face, shoulders, and chest. They are otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this patient’s clinical features?","The clinical features described in the teenager suggest that they might have a chromosomal abnormality. Key characteristics include tall stature significantly taller than family members, developmental delays (especially in language development), difficulty with behavior and school performance, and severe acne. These features fit a profile commonly associated with **Klinefelter syndrome**, which typically presents in males.

**Klinefelter syndrome** is a genetic condition where a male is born with an extra X chromosome, resulting in a 47,XXY karyotype. The clinical presentation can include tall stature, learning difficulties, social and behavioral problems, and more severe acne. Therefore, the most likely karyotype associated with this patient’s clinical features is:

**47,XXY.**",47 XYY,No
7,"A 72-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native individual presents to their primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. They state that their trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. They are able to hear when someone is speaking to them; however, they have difficulty with understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to their current symptoms, they report a steady ringing in both ears and at times experience dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for their parent being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. Their temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally in both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","This patient's symptoms of progressive hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech especially with background noise, steady ringing in both ears (tinnitus), and occasional dizziness, along with their history and physical examination findings, suggest a diagnosis of presbycusis.

Presbycusis is age-related hearing loss and is the most common cause of hearing impairment in older adults. The patient’s symptoms began several years ago and have progressively worsened, which is consistent with the gradual nature of presbycusis. 

Additionally, presbycusis is characterized by high-frequency hearing loss, which affects the ability to understand speech, especially in noisy environments. Tinnitus and balance issues like dizziness can also be associated with age-related degenerative changes in the auditory and vestibular systems.

The physical examination findings support this diagnosis:
- The Weber test, which involves placing a tuning fork on the forehead, shows that the sound is heard equally in both ears, indicating either normal hearing or symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss.
- The Rinne test, which compares air conduction (AC) to bone conduction (BC), shows that air conduction is greater than bone conduction in both ears, which is consistent with either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss.

Given the age of the patient and the pattern of hearing loss, presbycusis (sensorineural hearing loss due to aging) is the most likely diagnosis. 

Final diagnosis: **Presbycusis.**",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,no
8,"A 68-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native person presents to the office for an annual physical examination. This individual has no current complaints, and their past medical history is unremarkable. They report a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is only notable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when they cough. A non-contrast CT scan of their chest is performed, and the doctor informs them that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in the upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised by this news since they have never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs them that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease. The doctor says that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms, which is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this patient?","The concept being described by the doctor to the patient is ""lead-time bias."" Lead-time bias refers to the appearance that screening tests increase survival time simply because the disease was detected earlier, not because the patient actually lives longer. This bias can make it seem as though early detection has improved outcomes when, in reality, it has just extended the time during which the disease is known to be present without necessarily changing the course of the disease.

In the context of lung cancer, the doctor is explaining that the disease can be present and detectable via screening for a long time before symptoms actually develop. This early detection, while useful for implementing timely intervention, might lead to the perception that the earlier diagnosis has extended life expectancy, when it has primarily just extended the period of awareness of the disease. Early screening in individuals with risk factors, such as a significant smoking history, aims to find the disease at a stage when treatment might be more effective, thereby potentially improving actual outcomes.",Latent period,No
9,"A 24-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native individual comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. The patient reports cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. The patient claims that this is the 5th episode within the past year and is concerned if “there’s something else going on.” The patient's medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with an albuterol inhaler. The laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39 %
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The most likely diagnosis for this patient, considering the history of recurrent sinus infections, asthma, and the laboratory findings showing low levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM), is **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**.

CVID is characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins and increased susceptibility to infections, particularly of the respiratory tract. The laboratory results show:

- IgA: 54 mg/dL (below normal)
- IgE: 0 IU/mL (within normal range, although low levels of IgE are not typically diagnostic in isolation)
- IgG: 470 mg/dL (below normal)
- IgM: 29 mg/dL (below normal)

These findings align with CVID, where patients have diminished antibody responses, leading to recurrent respiratory infections, among other clinical manifestations. The repeated episodes of sinusitis in this patient support this diagnosis.

Management typically involves regular intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of infections. Further immunological evaluation and referral to an immunologist would be appropriate for confirming the diagnosis and formulating a treatment plan.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"A 33-year-old White individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, they have had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. They feel like they cannot fully empty their bowels. They have no history of serious illness and maintain a high-fiber diet. Their father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. They appear well. Their temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Their hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's presentation features a constellation of symptoms and signs that point towards inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Crohn's disease. Here are the key findings that support this diagnosis:

1. **Chronic Gastrointestinal Symptoms**: The patient has a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea.
2. **Weight Loss**: They have experienced a significant weight loss of 5 kg (11 lb).
3. **Incomplete Bowel Evacuations**: They report a sensation of incomplete bowel movements.
4. **Family History**: The patient’s father being of Ashkenazi Jewish descent is relevant as this population has a higher prevalence of Crohn's disease.
5. **Physical Examination**: Mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant on abdominal examination without guarding or rebound.
6. **Hematologic Findings**: Elevated leukocyte count (12,000 mm^3), elevated platelet count (480,000 mm^3), anemia (hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL), and significantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (129 mm/h) are indicative of an inflammatory process.
7. **Radiologic Findings**: Barium enema showing ulceration and narrowing of the right colon, a typical finding in Crohn’s disease, which often affects the terminal ileum and the proximal colon.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Crohn's disease**. This condition is characterized by transmural inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, although it commonly involves the terminal ileum and the right colon, resulting in the findings seen on the barium enema.

In contrast:
- **Ulcerative colitis** typically involves continuous colonic involvement starting from the rectum and does not involve the small intestine, and it is less likely to cause the stricturing seen in the barium enema.
- **Celiac disease** primarily presents with malabsorption symptoms and does not typically cause the colonic ulcers and strictures noted on the barium study.
- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)** does not cause the inflammatory changes, weight loss, anemia, or elevated inflammatory markers seen in this patient.
- **Colonic neoplasms** might present with similar symptoms but are less common at this age and not typically associated with the diffuse inflammatory changes and absence of occult blood.

Therefore, **Crohn's disease** is the most consistent diagnosis given the provided clinical and diagnostic information.",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a 27-year-old Asian individual is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm3 in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. Their temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","Given the patient's critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU), their nutritional management is essential for recovery. After a major surgery like a craniotomy, ensuring adequate nutrition is crucial to support healing and prevent complications.

For this patient, **enteral nutrition** is often preferred over parenteral nutrition if the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is functional. Enteral nutrition is associated with better outcomes, including a lower risk of infection, maintenance of gut integrity, and overall better utilization of nutrients.

Therefore, the **most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition is to initiate enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube or another suitable enteral feeding method**. This approach should be taken unless there are contraindications such as severe GI dysfunction, bowel obstruction, or other conditions where the GI tract cannot be used. In such instances, parenteral nutrition might be considered, but this is usually reserved for cases where enteral nutrition is not feasible.

Here’s a step-wise approach for nutritional management in this patient:
1. **Assess the GI function**: Ensure the patient does not have contraindications to enteral nutrition (e.g., bowel obstruction, severe GI necrosis).
2. **Initiate enteral nutrition**: Start with a low rate of enteral feeding and advance as tolerated, monitoring for tolerance and complications.
3. **Monitor and adjust**: Regularly check for signs of feeding intolerance (e.g., high gastric residuals, vomiting) and adjust the feeding regimen accordingly.

Given the current ventilator settings and stable vital signs, the initiation of enteral nutrition is appropriate to promote recovery and provide the needed nutrients for healing.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"A 5-year-old Asian child with developmental delays presents to the pediatrician's office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of their knees, elbows, and around their eyelids. The patient's parent notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since the child was an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the patient’s skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in their sweat and urine. Based on the patient’s symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","Based on the patient's symptoms and history, which are suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), the most appropriate dietary recommendation would be to **restrict phenylalanine intake**. 

PKU is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme deficiency leads to elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood, which can cause developmental delays, intellectual disability, hypopigmentation (including lighter skin, hair, and eyes), and a musty odor due to the presence of phenylacetate in the sweat and urine.

The child's itchy rash on flexor surfaces (which might be eczema) can also be seen in PKU patients, though eczema is not specific to PKU. 

A phenylalanine-restricted diet involves avoiding high-protein foods such as meat, dairy products, eggs, nuts, and beans, as well as some artificial sweeteners (e.g., aspartame), which are high in phenylalanine. Instead, a special medical formula that provides protein without phenylalanine and other essential nutrients should be used to ensure proper nutrition.

Therefore, the most appropriate dietary recommendation for this patient is to **restrict phenylalanine intake**.",Avoid meat,Yes
13,A 70-year-old White individual presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. They have had hypertension for 20 years and are currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"In a 70-year-old individual with a 20-year history of hypertension and a current blood pressure reading of 150/100 mm Hg, the most likely cause of changes observed in the left ventricle on echocardiography is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). 

Chronic hypertension leads to increased systemic vascular resistance, which means the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood against the higher pressure. Over time, this increased workload causes the muscle of the left ventricle to thicken, a condition known as hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a common adaptive response to chronic hypertension and can lead to diastolic dysfunction and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

It's important to further manage and optimize the individual's blood pressure to prevent progression of LVH and other associated complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"A 25-year-old Asian construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of their skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. They also complain of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. They are a smoker, but recently have grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis?","The patient's diagnosis is acute hepatitis A, as indicated by the positive anti-HAV IgM. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route. This can occur through:

1. **Consumption of contaminated food or water:** Poor sanitation and hygiene practices can lead to the contamination of food and water supplies with HAV.
2. **Close personal contact:** This includes living with or caring for an infected person and can also occur during sexual activities that might involve oral-anal contact.
3. **Traveling to areas with higher prevalence:** Individuals who travel to regions where hepatitis A is more common are at higher risk.

Given that the patient is a construction worker, it is plausible they might have been exposed through contaminated food or water, especially if their work environment has hygiene issues or if they have recently traveled to an area with poor sanitation.

Therefore, the most common mode of transmission for the patient's hepatitis A is the **consumption of contaminated food or water**.",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"A 5-year-old Black/African American child is brought to the clinic by their parent for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is home schooled and the parent is concerned about the child’s development. The child is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on the alphabet."" The child always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind.” The patient is observed to be focused on playing with their cars during the interview. Physical examination demonstrates a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The description of the patient's clinical presentation, including poor eye contact, delayed speech development, and physical features such as a prominent jaw, single palmar crease, and enlarged testicles, are suggestive of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Fragile X Syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.

The most likely mechanism underlying Fragile X Syndrome involves:

1. **Genetic Mutation:** Fragile X Syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome. Specifically, the condition is associated with an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene.

2. **Gene Silencing:** When the CGG repeat expansion exceeds a certain threshold (usually more than 200 repeats), it leads to hypermethylation of the FMR1 gene and silencing of its expression.

3. **Loss of FMRP:** The silencing of the FMR1 gene results in a deficiency of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which is crucial for normal neural development. The lack of FMRP disrupts synaptic function and plasticity, leading to the cognitive and behavioral impairments seen in Fragile X Syndrome.

In summary, the mechanism of this child's findings is primarily due to the genetic mutation of the FMR1 gene leading to reduced levels or absence of FMRP, which plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system. Further genetic testing (e.g., DNA analysis for CGG repeat expansion) would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Early intervention and support for developmental delays can be crucial for improving outcomes in children with Fragile X Syndrome.",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"A 65-year-old Black/African American individual is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. They have had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. They have gastritis as well as advanced Parkinson disease and currently live in an assisted-living community. They smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. They have a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but have not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. Their temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), they are tachycardic and tachypneic, and their oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
A x-ray of the chest shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?","The patient presents with a clinical picture suggestive of pneumonia, evidenced by their fever, productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, and the chest X-ray showing infiltrates in the right upper lobe. The presence of an elevated leukocyte count and increased lactic acid further supports an infectious process. Given the right upper lobe involvement and foul-smelling sputum, aspiration pneumonia should be strongly considered. 

In a patient with aspiration pneumonia, the most significant predisposing factor in this case would likely be advanced Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease can lead to dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) due to impaired coordination of the muscles involved in swallowing. Dysphagia increases the risk of aspiration, especially in individuals with additional risk factors such as being in an assisted-living community where the risk of aspiration events may be higher due to potential care dependency and handling of feeding.

Other contributing factors include the patient's history of alcohol abuse, which can also compromise lung function and aspiration defenses, and their decreased functional reserve due to age and comorbidities. Additionally, the past history of heavy tobacco use could have contributed to chronic lung disease, although the direct relationship with the acute presentation is less likely compared to the immediate risks posed by dysphagia in Parkinson disease.

Thus, given the clinical presentation and the known complications of Parkinson disease, the most significant predisposing factor for this patient’s respiratory symptoms is **advanced Parkinson disease** leading to potential aspiration pneumonia.","Parkinson disease

17,A 37-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native individual is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this patient?,"The nerve running between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles in the forearm is the median nerve. Damage to the median nerve can result in sensory loss in specific areas of the hand.

The areas most likely affected by sensation loss due to median nerve damage are:
- The palmar surface of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger.
- The tips of these fingers on the dorsal side (nail beds of the thumb, index, middle, and lateral half of the ring finger).

Therefore, the patient is most likely to experience loss of sensation over the palmar surface of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger.",Fingertip of the index finger,No
18,"A 46-year-old Black/African American individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, they received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. Their blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; their vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's increase in creatinine concentration?","This 46-year-old individual, who received a kidney transplant 5 years ago and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy with sirolimus and mycophenolate, presents with progressively worsening fatigue, loss of appetite, elevated blood pressure, normocytic normochromic anemia, and a significantly elevated serum creatinine concentration. These findings point toward potential renal dysfunction.

The most likely underlying mechanism for this patient's increase in creatinine concentration is **chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN)** or chronic rejection. 

**Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN)** refers to progressive loss of kidney transplant function over time, characterized by fibrosis and sclerosis within the transplanted kidney. Risk factors for CAN include:

1. **Chronic calcineurin inhibitor toxicity**: Commonly seen with drugs like cyclosporine and tacrolimus, though this patient is on sirolimus and mycophenolate.
2. **Chronic antibody-mediated rejection**: Continuous immune-mediated injury to the allograft.
3. **Non-adherence to immunosuppressive medications**: Which can lead to chronic rejection.
4. **Hypertension**: Elevated blood pressure, as seen in this patient, can contribute to graft damage.
5. **Infections and recurrent episodes of acute rejection**: They can cause chronic damage over time.

Given the patient’s history of kidney transplantation, their current presentation, and progression over a few months, CAN is a plausible cause. This diagnosis aligns with the clinical picture, including the gradual elevation in serum creatinine and the development of anemia (which can be secondary to chronic kidney disease and resultant reduced erythropoietin production).

Further diagnostic work should include a kidney biopsy to confirm the extent of fibrosis and other pathological features indicative of CAN. Aggressive control of blood pressure and careful monitoring and adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy would be crucial parts of management.

**Summary**: The most likely underlying mechanism for the increase in this patient's creatinine concentration is chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), a result of progressive, chronic damage to the transplanted kidney.",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,No
19,"A 34-year-old White person with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, the patient is started on high-dose folate supplementation, and follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. The patient is at risk for which long-term complication?","The patient's lab results initially indicated macrocytic anemia (with an elevated mean corpuscular volume or MCV of 106 fL), which improved after folate supplementation (MCV decreased to 96 fL). This suggests that the folate deficiency may have been a contributing factor to their anemia. However, the patient has a history of a gastric sleeve operation, which can predispose them to multiple nutritional deficiencies due to reduced absorption capabilities.

While the improved lab values following folate supplementation are encouraging, it is important to also consider and address the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency in this patient. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause macrocytic anemia and may coexist with folate deficiency. Moreover, treating folate deficiency without addressing concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency can potentially mask and exacerbate neurological complications related to vitamin B12 deficiency.

Therefore, the patient is at risk for long-term neurological complications, such as:
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Posterior column demyelination leading to sensory ataxia
- Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord

It would be prudent to check the patient's vitamin B12 levels and address any deficiency to mitigate the risk of these severe and potentially irreversible neurologic complications.",Peripheral neuropathy,Yes
