0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, a 42-year-old Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander man is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless, enlargement of his scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for an episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition?","The patient's presentation suggests a condition caused by lymphatic obstruction. Given the geographic context (southeast Asia) and the clinical findings (painless enlargement of the scrotum that transilluminates, episodic fever), the most likely underlying mechanism is lymphatic filariasis.

Lymphatic filariasis is caused by infection with filarial parasites, specifically Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or Brugia timori, which are transmitted by mosquito bites. These parasites can cause blockages in the lymphatic system, leading to lymphedema and, notably in men, scrotal swelling or hydrocele from the accumulation of lymphatic fluid.

Hydrocele presents as a painless, enlarged scrotum that typically transilluminates on physical examination, which aligns with the findings in this patient. The history of episodic fever could correlate with the acute inflammatory response associated with filarial infections.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Lymphatic filariasis.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,No
1,"A 27-year-old Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander G1P1001 is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section. Her surgery was indicated for breech presentation of the infant. She was at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation at the time of delivery. The patient is now complaining of purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding. She also notes difficulty and discomfort with urination. The patient’s prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis, which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. The patient has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, her temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Exam reveals that she is uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Her lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and her uterus is slightly boggy and soft. There is mild tenderness with uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this patient's condition?","The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with postpartum endometritis, a common infection following a Caesarean section, especially in the context of retained products of conception or prolonged rupture of membranes. The purulent lochia, fever, and boggy uterus suggest a uterine infection.

In the management of postpartum endometritis, the best next step is to start broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. The typical antibiotic regimen includes clindamycin and gentamicin, which cover a wide range of likely pathogens, including anaerobes, gram-negative organisms, and gram-positive cocci.

Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is:

**Initiate intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, typically clindamycin and gentamicin.**

In addition to starting antibiotics, it's important to:
- Monitor the patient closely, both clinically and with relevant laboratory tests.
- Ensure adequate hydration and symptom management.
- Assess for any need for further interventions, such as imaging or surgical evaluation, if the patient does not respond to initial antibiotic therapy.

If there is no improvement with antibiotics, further investigations may be needed to rule out other complications like retained products of conception, abscess formation, or other sources of infection.

Let's summarize:
- **Start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics** (clindamycin and gentamicin).
- **Monitor closely for clinical improvements**.
- **Consider further evaluation** only if there is no improvement with initial therapy.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy 19-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native man is brought to the emergency department by his girlfriend after briefly losing consciousness. He passed out while moving furniture into her apartment. She said that he was unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness and was not confused. The patient did not have any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. He has had episodes of dizziness when exercising at the gym. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a genetic condition often seen in young individuals and can lead to syncope (fainting) and dizziness, especially during physical exertion.

The key features in this case that suggest HCM include:
- The patient's age and the brief loss of consciousness (syncope) during exertion.
- A history of dizziness when exercising, which is a common symptom of HCM.
- The presence of a systolic murmur, which increases with standing and decreases with passive leg elevation. This dynamic murmur is characteristic of HCM. The maneuvers affect the venous return to the heart, and in HCM, the murmur is typically louder when less blood is returning to the heart (standing) and softer when more blood is returning (passive leg elevation).

In HCM, the thickened heart muscle can obstruct the flow of blood out of the heart, particularly during physical activity when the heart is working harder. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and syncope.

Therefore, given the clinical presentation and examination findings, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most likely diagnosis.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"A 27-year-old Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander woman presents for a checkup. She is 20 weeks pregnant and has been admitted to the hospital multiple times during her pregnancy for seizures. She has a known seizure disorder but discontinued her valproic acid when she became pregnant. The patient's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. She generally prefers not to take medications and sees a shaman for her care typically. Given her recent hospitalization, the patient agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time?","Given the patient's history of seizures and her decision to discontinue valproic acid due to pregnancy, it's crucial to find a balance between managing her seizure disorder and ensuring the safety of her pregnancy. Valproic acid is known to have higher teratogenic risks, especially neural tube defects, which is likely why she discontinued its use. Carbamazepine, while also having some teratogenic risks, is generally considered safer than valproic acid during pregnancy.

The most appropriate course of action given the context involves several key considerations:

1. **Initiation of Carbamazepine:** Since the patient has agreed to start carbamazepine, it should be initiated as it is an effective anticonvulsant that can help manage her seizures.

2. **Folic Acid Supplementation:** It is crucial to start high-dose folic acid supplementation (4-5 mg daily) to reduce the risk of neural tube defects associated with antiepileptic drugs, including carbamazepine.

3. **Close Monitoring:** Given her history of multiple hospitalizations due to seizures during this pregnancy, regular monitoring of seizure activity, carbamazepine levels, and fetal development should be instituted.

4. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Involving a neurologist and an obstetrician with experience in managing high-risk pregnancies is essential to ensure both maternal and fetal well-being.

5. **Cultural Sensitivity:** Continue to show respect for her preference for traditional care with a shaman, and encourage an integrated approach that includes both medical and traditional practices to ensure she feels supported and respected in her healthcare decisions.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment involves starting carbamazepine while providing high-dose folic acid supplementation and careful monitoring throughout the pregnancy. This way, her seizure disorder is managed while minimizing potential risks to her pregnancy.

Summarizing the key steps:
1. **Start carbamazepine.**
2. **Supplement with high-dose folic acid.**
3. **Regular monitoring by healthcare professionals.**
4. **Involve both her shaman and medical doctors in her care plan.**

This holistic approach should provide the best outcomes for both mother and baby.",Folate,Yes
4,"A 45-year-old White woman presents to her primary care physician for an annual checkup. She states that she feels well and has no complaints. She lives alone and works as a banker. She smokes 1 cigarette per day and drinks 2 alcoholic beverages per night. She occasionally gets symmetrical pain in her hands where they change from red to white to blue then return to normal again. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and she returns 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in her legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in her extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","The patient's presentation raises some important clinical considerations, including her recent development of bilateral edema in her extremities, uncontrolled hypertension, and her history of Raynaud's phenomenon (indicated by the color changes in her hands).

Given these factors, the best next step in management would include a focused diagnostic evaluation to determine the underlying cause of her new symptoms. The development of bilateral edema, particularly if it developed over a short period, warrants an assessment of renal function among other potential underlying etiologies.

**The best next step in management would be to order basic laboratory tests, including:**

1. **Serum Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** To evaluate renal function. Poor kidney function can lead to fluid retention and hypertension.
2. **Urinalysis:** To check for proteinuria or other abnormalities that may suggest renal pathology.
3. **Electrolytes:** To assess for any imbalance that could contribute to edema.
4. **Albumin and Liver Function Tests:** To exclude hypoalbuminemia and liver disease, which can also cause edema.
5. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia or any signs of systemic disease.
6. **Thyroid Function Tests:** Hypothyroidism can present with edema and weight gain.

Since she has significant hypertension that did not appear to be immediately controlled, it’s important to ensure that her blood pressure management regimen is optimal and to consider secondary causes of hypertension, such as renal artery stenosis, which could also contribute to her symptoms.

Additional specialized tests may be needed depending on the initial lab results, such as an echocardiogram if heart failure is suspected, or specific imaging if renal artery stenosis needs to be ruled out.

**Steps to address her Raynaud's phenomenon:**
Advise her to keep warm, avoid smoking, and manage stress. Consider referring her to a rheumatologist if symptoms are severe or suggestive of an underlying connective tissue disease.

Comprehensive management of this patient will therefore involve treating her hypertension, evaluating the cause of her edema, and addressing modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use.",Lisinopril,No
5,"A 42-year-old White man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. He was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in this patient is most likely due to its action as a **phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor**. 

In patients with systemic sclerosis, the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a known complication, and tadalafil is commonly used in this context. Here's how tadalafil works:

- Tadalafil inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), which is prevalent in the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary vasculature.
- By inhibiting PDE-5, tadalafil increases the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in these cells.
- Elevated cGMP leads to relaxation of smooth muscle cells and subsequent vasodilation of the pulmonary arteries.
- This results in a reduction of pulmonary arterial pressure and alleviates symptoms associated with PAH such as worsening shortness of breath with exertion.

In summary, tadalafil's beneficial effect in this patient with PAH secondary to systemic sclerosis is primarily due to **vasodilation of the pulmonary arteries** through the inhibition of PDE-5, leading to elevated cGMP levels and improved pulmonary blood flow.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,No
6,"A 17-year-old Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander is brought to his primary care provider by his mother. They are concerned that his acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over-the-counter products without success. He is otherwise healthy and without complaint. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. He is having trouble with school and has a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, he stands 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members with inflamed pustular acne on his face, shoulders, and chest. He is otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this patient’s clinical features?","Given the clinical features of the patient, including the tall stature, delayed language development, behavioral issues, and acne, it is worth considering a chromosomal abnormality as a possible underlying factor. One such condition that fits these characteristics is **Klinefelter syndrome**, which typically has the karyotype **47,XXY**.

Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that affects males who have an extra X chromosome. Boys and men with this syndrome may exhibit taller than average height, learning disabilities (especially affecting language development), and occasionally behavioral issues. Acne can also be more severe in individuals with this condition.

Therefore, the karyotype that is most likely associated with the patient's clinical features is:

**47,XXY**

While there could be other considerations, based on the information provided, Klinefelter syndrome is a strong possibility. A karyotype analysis would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",47 XYY,No
7,"A 72-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native man presents to his primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. He states that his trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. He is able to hear when someone is speaking to him; however, he has difficulty with understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to his current symptoms, he reports a steady ringing in both ears, and at times experiences dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for his father being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally in both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","Based on the provided presentation, the patient's progressively worsening hearing loss over the past 7-8 years, difficulty understanding speech especially in noisy environments, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and occasional dizziness most likely point toward a diagnosis of **presbycusis**. Given the physical exam findings and patient history, let's analyze why presbycusis is the most plausible cause:

1. **History of Progressive Symptoms**: The patient's hearing loss has been gradually worsening over several years, which is typical for presbycusis, the age-related hearing loss.

2. **Difficulty Understanding Speech**: This symptom is characteristic of presbycusis due to the loss of high-frequency hearing, which is essential for understanding speech, particularly consonants.

3. **Tinnitus**: This is commonly associated with presbycusis.

4. **Dizziness**: While less specific, dizziness can also accompany presbycusis due to age-related changes in the inner ear.

5. **Physical Examination & Tuning Fork Tests**:
   - The **Weber test** shows that the sound is heard equally in both ears, which suggests either normal hearing or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
   - The **Rinne test** shows air conduction (AC) is greater than bone conduction (BC) bilaterally (AC > BC), which is consistent with normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss rather than conductive hearing loss.

6. **Family History**: The history of his father having a cholesteatoma is insightful but less relevant compared to his symptoms and physical examination findings, which do not indicate signs typical of cholesteatoma (e.g., hearing loss specific to one ear, ear discharge).

Given these points, the patient's presentation and examination findings align well with **presbycusis** rather than a conductive hearing loss or other ear pathologies like cholesteatoma or otosclerosis. Presbycusis is a common cause of hearing loss in the elderly and best fits the described clinical picture.

Thus, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:

**Presbycusis**.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,No
8,"A 68-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native man presents to the office for his annual physical examination. He has no current complaints. Past medical history is unremarkable. He reports a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is only remarkable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when he coughs. A non-contrast CT scan of his chest is performed, and the doctor informs him that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in his upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised by this news since he has never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs him that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease. The doctor says that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms, which is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this patient?","The concept being described by the doctor to this patient is **""Lead-time bias.""**

Lead-time bias occurs when early detection of a disease (e.g., through screening) makes it seem like the patient has survived longer simply because the disease was diagnosed earlier, not because the progression or outcome of the disease has changed. In the context of lung cancer, the patient may not experience symptoms until the disease is advanced, but early screening can detect the disease at an earlier stage, potentially leading to earlier intervention and a better prognosis. However, this earlier detection does not necessarily extend the patient’s life expectancy from the moment the disease would have become symptomatic; it just extends the time the patient knows about the disease.",Latent period,No
9,"A 24-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native woman comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. She reports cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. She claims that this is her 5th episode within the past year and is concerned if “there’s something else going on.” Her medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with her albuterol inhaler. Her laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39 %
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's presentation of recurrent sinus infections along with her laboratory findings suggest an immunodeficiency, specifically a primary antibody deficiency. The key findings in her laboratory results are the low levels of immunoglobulins:

- IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
- IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
- IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

These lab abnormalities, together with the clinical history of recurrent respiratory infections, are suggestive of **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**. CVID is characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and/or IgM) leading to an impaired ability to mount an adequate immune response to infections, particularly those involving the respiratory tract.

CVID should be considered in a patient with a history of recurrent infections (such as sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia) and significantly low serum immunoglobulins. It is important to diagnose and manage CVID properly, as patients may require immunoglobulin replacement therapy and close monitoring for potential complications. A consultation with an immunologist would be an appropriate next step for further evaluation and management.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"A 33-year-old White woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. She feels like she cannot fully empty her bowels. She has no history of serious illness. She has a high-fiber diet. Her father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. She appears well. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The symptoms and clinical findings described suggest an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with Crohn's disease being the most likely diagnosis. Here are key points that support this diagnosis:

1. **Symptoms**: 
   - Intermittent lower abdominal cramps
   - Diarrhea
   - Bloating
   - Mild nausea
   - Weight loss
   - Incomplete bowel evacuation

2. **Physical Examination**:
   - Mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant
   - No guarding or rebound, normal bowel sounds

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Mild anemia (Hemoglobin concentration 10.5 g/dL)
   - Elevated leukocyte count (12,000 mm3)
   - Thrombocytosis (Platelet count 480,000 mm3)
   - Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR 129 mm/h)

4. **Imaging Study**:
   - Barium enema showing ulceration and narrowing of the right colon

5. **Family History**:
   - Her father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, which is a recognized risk factor for Crohn's disease.

The constellation of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, systemic inflammatory signs (anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated ESR), and radiologic evidence of ulceration and narrowing in the right colon are characteristic of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, but it commonly affects the terminal ileum and the right colon, which is consistent with the location of the abdominal tenderness.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Crohn's disease**.",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a 27-year-old Asian man is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm3 in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","Given that the patient is in a stable condition postoperatively with controlled vital signs and mechanical ventilation, it is important to address his nutritional needs to promote recovery and prevent malnutrition and its complications.

In the setting of critical illness, such as in this patient with a traumatic brain injury and subsequent surgery, early initiation of enteral nutrition is generally recommended if the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is functional and there are no contraindications (e.g., bowel obstruction, severe ileus, or other GI complications).

The benefits of early enteral nutrition include:

1. Preservation of gut integrity and prevention of gut atrophy.
2. Reduction in the risk of infections due to maintaining gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) function.
3. Improved clinical outcomes and reduced length of hospital stay.

With this in mind, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition is to **initiate enteral nutrition via a nasogastric or nasoenteric tube**.

- **Enteral nutrition (EN)**: Initiating enteral nutrition within the first 24-48 hours after admission to the ICU for critically ill patients is associated with improved outcomes. If this patient’s GI tract is functional, a nasogastric (NG) or nasoenteric (NE) tube can be placed for feeding. Enteral nutrition is preferable over parenteral nutrition due to the maintenance of GI tract function and lower risk of infections.

If the GI tract is not usable due to complications, then parental nutrition could be considered, but this is generally reserved for scenarios where enteral feeding is not feasible.

Therefore, the next step should be:
### Initiate enteral nutrition via a nasogastric or nasoenteric tube

Close monitoring of the patient's tolerance to enteral nutrition should be done, and adjustments should be made as needed. Regular assessments by a dietitian may also aid in optimizing the nutrition plan.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"A 5-year-old Asian boy with developmental delays presents to his pediatrician’s office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of his knees, elbows, and around his eyelids. The patient’s mother notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since the child was an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the patient’s skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in his sweat and urine. Based on the patient’s symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","Based on the patient's symptoms and history, including developmental delays, a persistent itchy rash on flexor surfaces, hypopigmentation, and a musty body odor, the most likely diagnosis is phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, which can cause brain damage, developmental delays, and other symptoms such as eczema-like rashes, hypopigmentation, and a musty odor.

The most appropriate dietary recommendation for a patient with PKU is:
- **Low-phenylalanine diet**: This involves restricting foods high in phenylalanine and consuming a diet low in this amino acid to prevent its buildup. Foods high in protein, such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, nuts, and some legumes, are usually restricted or eliminated from the diet.
- **Special medical formula**: To ensure adequate nutrition, patients are often given a special medical formula that provides essential nutrients without phenylalanine.

Therefore, the most appropriate dietary recommendation is to implement a **low-phenylalanine diet**. It is essential to consult with a metabolic specialist and a dietitian experienced in managing PKU to develop an individualized dietary plan that ensures adequate nutrition while minimizing phenylalanine intake. Regular monitoring of phenylalanine levels in the blood is also crucial to manage the condition effectively.",Avoid meat,Yes
13,A 70-year-old White man presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. He has had hypertension for 20 years and is currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"The most likely reason for the changes observed in the left ventricle on echocardiography in a 70-year-old man with a 20-year history of hypertension is hypertensive heart disease, specifically left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

Chronic hypertension increases the workload on the heart, particularly the left ventricle, which must pump blood against higher systemic resistance. Over time, this increased workload leads to adaptive changes in the cardiac muscle. These changes often manifest as hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall.

Left ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in the size and thickness of the myocardial fibers, which may appear on echocardiography as an increased left ventricular mass and wall thickness. LVH is a common finding in patients with long-standing hypertension and can lead to various complications, including diastolic dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.

Management of hypertensive heart disease involves optimizing blood pressure control with appropriate antihypertensive therapy, lifestyle modifications, and regular monitoring to assess cardiac function and prevent progression of the disease.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"A 25-year-old Asian construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of his skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. He also complains of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. He is a smoker, but recently has grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis?","Based on the information provided, this patient has positive anti-HAV IgM, suggesting an acute Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. HAV is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver and is commonly transmitted via the fecal-oral route. This transmission mode is typically associated with ingestion of contaminated food or water due to poor sanitation and hygiene.

Here are key points about Hepatitis A transmission:
- **Fecal-Oral Route**: The most common mode of transmission for Hepatitis A is through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces from an infected person.
- **Person-to-Person Contact**: Close personal contact with an infected person, such as within households, in childcare settings, or among sexual partners, can also lead to transmission.
- **Contaminated Food and Water**: Outbreaks can occur due to contaminated food (e.g., shellfish) or water, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation.

Given this patient's demographic and the noted symptoms, it is likely that he contracted HAV through one of these routes, with the most common being ingestion of contaminated food or water. 

Therefore, the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis of Hepatitis A is the **fecal-oral route**.",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"A 5-year-old Black/African American boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is home schooled and mom is concerned about her son’s development. He is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on his alphabet."" He always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind.” The patient is observed to be focused on playing with his cars during the interview. Physical examination demonstrates a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The presentation of a 5-year-old boy with developmental delays, poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles is suggestive of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Fragile X Syndrome is a genetic condition caused predominantly by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome. 

**Mechanism Explanation:**
1. **Genetic Mutation:** In Fragile X Syndrome, there is an abnormal expansion of the CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. A normal FMR1 gene has roughly 5–40 copies of the CGG repeat. In individuals with Fragile X Syndrome, the number of repeats exceeds 200, leading to a full mutation.
   
2. **Epigenetic Changes:** The extensive CGG repeats result in methylation of the FMR1 gene, which silences its expression. This prevents the production of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a crucial protein for normal neural development.

3. **Cell Function Impact:** Lack of FMRP leads to abnormalities in synaptic development and function. This results in the intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and behavioral issues characteristic of Fragile X Syndrome.

**Key Features Supporting Fragile X Syndrome:**
- **Developmental Delays:** The child has delays in speech (only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences) and struggles with learning the alphabet.
- **Behavioral Observations:** Poor eye contact and seeming disinterest are common in children with FXS, as are difficulties with attention and social interactions.
- **Physical Examination Findings:**
  - **Prominent Jaw:** A common phenotypic feature of FXS.
  - **Single Palmar Crease:** Sometimes seen in various genetic conditions, including FXS.
  - **Macroorchidism (Enlarged Testicles):** Typically becomes more apparent after puberty but can be noticeable in younger children as well.

Given these observations and the characteristic physical and developmental concerns, the most likely mechanism underlying this patient's condition is a CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene leading to a deficiency in FMRP, consistent with Fragile X Syndrome. Confirmatory genetic testing would typically involve molecular analysis to assess the number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene.",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"A 65-year-old Black/African American man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. He has had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. He has gastritis as well as advanced Parkinson disease and currently lives in an assisted-living community. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. He has a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but has not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. His temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), he is tachycardic and tachypneic, and his oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
A chest x-ray shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?","This 65-year-old man presents with symptoms and signs consistent with a severe pulmonary infection, likely pneumonia, given the shortness of breath, chest pain, productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and abnormal chest x-ray findings.

The most significant predisposing factor in this case is his advanced Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease can cause several issues that predispose an individual to aspiration pneumonia, which is strongly suggested by the foul-smelling sputum and the location of the infiltrate (right upper lobe), often seen in aspiration events.

Here is the reasoning behind this:

- **Parkinson Disease**: Patients with advanced Parkinson disease often have difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia), decreased cough reflex, and impaired mobility, all of which increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents can lead to pneumonia, particularly in debilitated patients with neurological impairments.

- **Productive Cough with Foul-Smelling Sputum**: This is typically indicative of a bacterial infection, possibly anaerobes, which are commonly involved in aspiration pneumonia.

- **Right Upper Lung Infiltrate**: This location is commonly affected by aspiration in individuals who may be bedridden or have difficulty swallowing, which can be attributed to their medical condition (in this case, Parkinson disease).

Other factors such as a history of smoking and alcohol abuse, while contributory to lung disease and possibly increased infection risk, are not as directly linked to the acute presentation of aspiration pneumonia in comparison to the swallowing and cough reflex issues associated with Parkinson disease.

Therefore, advanced Parkinson disease is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms.","Parkinson disease

17,A 37-year-old American Indian/Alaska Native man is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this patient?,"The scenario describes a patient with a laceration to the right forearm and MRI findings indicating damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. The nerve in question is the median nerve, which travels in the forearm between these muscles.

Damage to the median nerve in this region can result in sensory deficits in specific areas of the hand. The median nerve provides sensory innervation to:

- The palmar side of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.
- The dorsal side of the distal phalanges of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.

Given that this patient has sustained an injury that damaged the median nerve, they are most likely to experience a loss of sensation in these areas.

Therefore, the area most likely to have loss of sensation in this patient is:

**The palmar side of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.**",Fingertip of the index finger,No
18,"A 46-year-old Black/African American man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, he received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. His blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; his vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration?","The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration is chronic allograft nephropathy.

This patient has a history of kidney transplantation and is currently on immunosuppressive medications (sirolimus and mycophenolate). Sirolimus and mycophenolate are used to prevent graft rejection, but despite immunosuppressive therapy, chronic allograft nephropathy can still occur. It is a common cause of kidney allograft dysfunction and is characterized by progressive renal failure that typically manifests several years after transplantation.

Several key points in this case support the diagnosis of chronic allograft nephropathy:
- Progressive increase in serum creatinine concentration over time, which indicates worsening renal function.
- Normocytic, normochromic anemia, which is commonly seen in chronic kidney disease, including chronic allograft nephropathy.
- Hypertension, which is a common finding in chronic kidney disease and can further impair renal function.
- The patient’s vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago, indicating a relatively rapid decline in kidney function over the last few months.

Given these findings, chronic allograft nephropathy is the most likely cause of the patient's increased creatinine concentration.",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,No
19,"A 34-year-old White female with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, she is started on high dose folate supplementation, and her follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. She is at risk for which long-term complication?","The patient presents with macrocytic anemia, evidenced by a low hemoglobin and hematocrit along with an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The initial suspicion was folate deficiency, for which she was started on high-dose folate supplementation. Follow-up labs indicate an improvement in her hemoglobin, hematocrit, and a decrease in MCV, suggesting that the folate supplementation has been effective.

However, given her history of a gastric sleeve operation, it is crucial to consider that she might also be at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. This type of surgery can lead to malabsorption issues, including vitamin B12 deficiency, because the stomach and its intrinsic factor, necessary for vitamin B12 absorption, are significantly altered. 

Vitamin B12 deficiency can also present with macrocytic anemia and can be masked initially by folate supplementation. Over time, untreated vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to serious and irreversible complications, such as neuropathy and neuropsychiatric disorders, due to its role in neurological function.

Therefore, even with her current improvement, she remains at risk for long-term complications associated with untreated vitamin B12 deficiency, including:

1. **Peripheral neuropathy:** Tingling, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet.
2. **Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord:** Leading to significant motor and sensory dysfunction.
3. **Cognitive impairments:** Including memory loss, confusion, or even dementia-like symptoms.
4. **Psychiatric symptoms:** Such as depression or irritability.

It would be prudent to check her vitamin B12 levels and initiate supplementation if a deficiency is found to prevent these potential long-term complications.",Peripheral neuropathy,Yes
