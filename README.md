## **Explaining Medical Decisions Made by AI**
This project is a product of my participation in a 2024 summer research experience for undergraduates (REU) at the University of Minnesota. The REU's focus is human-centered computing for social good, and I am advised by Professor Qianwen Wang.
### _Project description_
Our research group is interested in studying how large language models (LLMs) respond differently to various medical-related inquiries. Specifically, we are studying the difference in how LLMs respond to medical inquiries formulated in a professional tone versus in a demographic-specific tone. To test this, we will feed various types of medical-related questions into LLMs in three stages.
