0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, an individual is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless, enlargement of their scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for an episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition?","Based on the details provided, the patient's condition appears to be characterized by a progressive, painless enlargement of the scrotum over a long period, a background of episodic fever, and physical examination findings of an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. These features are highly suggestive of **lymphatic filariasis**, particularly caused by **Wuchereria bancrofti**, which is a common parasitic infection in certain parts of Southeast Asia.

Here is a detailed explanation of the underlying mechanism:

1. **Etiology**: Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the parasitic worms Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. The most common causative agent globally is Wuchereria bancrofti.

2. **Transmission**: The parasites are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, commonly the Culex, Anopheles, or Aedes species.

3. **Pathophysiology**:
   - Once inside the human host, the larvae migrate to the lymphatic system, where they mature into adult worms.
   - The adult worms reside in the lymphatic vessels and nodes, where they cause obstruction of lymphatic drainage.
   - Chronic infection results in a gradual accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the affected areas due to the impaired drainage caused by inflammation, fibrosis, and eventual obliteration of the lymphatic vessels. This leads to tissue swelling and enlargement, known as lymphedema.
   - In the scrotum, this condition can progress to form a hydrocele, characterized by the accumulation of fluid around the testicle, which transilluminates due to its fluid-filled nature.

4. **Symptoms and Clinical Findings**:
   - Chronic lymphedema resulting in painless swelling and enlargement of the limbs or genitalia.
   - Repeated episodes of fever known as acute adenolymphangitis, which corresponds to the episodic fever mentioned in the patient's history.
   - The absence of other systemic symptoms or malignancies helps differentiate it from other conditions like cancer.

Given these points, the underlying mechanism for the patient's condition is the **chronic obstruction of lymphatic drainage caused by adult filarial worms residing in the lymphatic system**, leading to **lymphedema and hydrocele formation**. This is a classic presentation of lymphatic filariasis, especially in endemic regions.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,Yes
1,"A G1P1001 individual is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section performed due to breech presentation of the infant. Delivery occurred at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation. The patient is now complaining of purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding, as well as difficulty and discomfort with urination. The prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. Medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. The exam reveals that the patient is uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and the uterus is slightly boggy and soft with mild tenderness upon uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this patient's condition?","The patient described is presenting with symptoms indicative of a postpartum infection, likely endometritis, given the purulent lochia, heavy bleeding, uterine tenderness, and elevated temperature. Endometritis is a common postpartum infection, particularly following a Cesarean section, and it typically requires prompt antibiotic treatment.

The best next step in management for this patient is to initiate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. The combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is commonly used due to their effectiveness against the polymicrobial nature of endometritis, covering both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

### Recommended Management:
1. **Initiate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics**:
   - **Clindamycin and gentamicin**: This combination covers a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Clindamycin provides good anaerobic coverage, while gentamicin is effective against aerobic Gram-negative organisms.
   - An alternative regimen could include ampicillin and sulbactam or a combination of other antibiotics as per hospital protocol and microbial culture results.

2. **Monitor the patient's vital signs and clinical response to antibiotics**: Close monitoring is necessary to ensure the patient is responding to treatment and not worsening.

3. **Assess for additional complications**: The patient’s difficulty and discomfort with urination may suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI) or even a retained bladder catheter effect secondary to the Cesarean section, which should be evaluated and managed accordingly.

Further diagnostic workup like blood cultures, urine cultures, and possibly ultrasound to rule out retained products of conception or abscess might be part of the management plan but should not delay the initiation of empiric antibiotics.

### Key Points:
- The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with postpartum endometritis.
- Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics is crucial.
- Continuous monitoring and potential additional diagnostic evaluations may be necessary.

By addressing the infection swiftly with appropriate antibiotic therapy, the risk of severe complications such as sepsis can be minimized, and the patient’s recovery can be supported effectively.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy individual is brought to the emergency department after briefly losing consciousness while moving furniture. A companion reports that they were unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness without confusion. The individual did not experience any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. They have had episodes of dizziness when exercising at the gym. Blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The clinical scenario described suggests the most likely cause is **hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)**.

### Key Points Supporting HOCM:
1. **Brief Loss of Consciousness (Syncope) During Exertion**: HOCM is a common cause of syncope, particularly during physical activity due to outflow obstruction that worsens with exertion.
2. **Dizziness with Exercise**: This symptom is consistent with impaired cardiac output under conditions that increase myocardial oxygen demand or reduce preload.
3. **Murmurs that Change with Posture**:
    - Systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
    - Systolic murmur at the apex.
    - Both murmurs disappear with passive leg elevation, which increases venous return/preload and reduces the intensity of the obstruction and hence the murmur.
4. **Absence of Symptoms Typically Linked to Other Conditions**:
    - No chest pain, reducing the likelihood of myocardial ischemia.
    - No palpitations or difficulty breathing, making primary arrhythmias or respiratory causes less likely.
5. **Normal Orthostatic Vital Signs**: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are stable when moving from supine to standing, reducing the likelihood of vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension.

### Pathophysiology of HOCM:
- HOCM is characterized by asymmetric hypertrophy of the interventricular septum, which can lead to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
- The murmur associated with HOCM typically increases with maneuvers that decrease preload (e.g., standing or Valsalva maneuver) and decreases with maneuvers that increase preload (e.g., squatting or passive leg elevation).
  
### Diagnosis and Management:
- **Echocardiography** is the diagnostic test of choice and would show asymmetric septal hypertrophy and possibly systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.
- **Management** often includes beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers to reduce myocardial demand and decrease outflow obstruction. Severe cases might need surgical intervention like septal myectomy.

Given the presentation and findings, HOCM is the most likely diagnosis.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"An individual presents for a checkup. They are 20 weeks pregnant and have been admitted to the hospital multiple times during their pregnancy for seizures. They have a known seizure disorder but discontinued their valproic acid when they became pregnant. The patient's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. They do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. They generally prefer not to take medications and typically see a shaman for their care. Given their recent hospitalization, the patient agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time?","The most appropriate treatment for this patient is the one that balances the management of their seizure disorder with the safety of the ongoing pregnancy. While valproic acid is generally avoided during pregnancy due to its teratogenic effects, especially during the first trimester, carbamazepine is often considered a safer alternative, although it too carries some risk of birth defects. 

Given that the patient has agreed to start carbamazepine and considering the context of her pregnancy and recent hospitalizations for seizures, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Initiate Carbamazepine:**
   - Start the patient on carbamazepine as agreed. The dosing must be managed carefully and titrated according to therapeutic drug monitoring and seizure control.

2. **Folic Acid Supplementation:**
   - It is crucial to prescribe a high dose of folic acid (4-5 mg daily), especially since antiepileptic drugs like carbamazepine can interfere with folate metabolism, which is important for neural tube development in the baby.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Conduct regular monitoring of carbamazepine levels to ensure therapeutic levels are maintained without reaching toxicity.
   - Regular ultrasound scans to monitor fetal development and detect any anomalies early, although carbamazepine is less teratogenic than valproate, some risk still exists.

4. **Seizure Diary and Regular Follow-ups:**
   - Encourage the patient to maintain a seizure diary to track any seizure activity and report immediately if there are breakthrough seizures.
   - Schedule regular follow-ups to adjust the medication dosage as necessary based on seizure control and any side effects experienced.

5. **Collaboration with Obstetric and Neurology Specialists:**
   - Maintain close collaboration with both obstetricians and neurologists to manage the dual aspects of pregnancy and seizure control effectively.
   - Ensure the obstetrician is aware of this medication due to its implications for the pregnancy.

6. **Counseling and Support:**
   - Provide thorough counseling on the importance of medication adherence to prevent seizures, which can pose significant risks to both the mother and the fetus.
   - Discuss the potential risks and benefits of the medication in the context of pregnancy, providing reassurance and support.

Given these considerations, starting carbamazepine along with the above measures represents the most suitable treatment plan for the patient in this specific situation.",Folate,No
4,"An individual presents to their primary care physician for an annual checkup, stating that they feel well and have no complaints. They live alone and work as a banker. They smoke 1 cigarette per day and drink 2 alcoholic beverages per night. They occasionally experience symmetrical pain in their hands where the color changes from red to white to blue before returning to normal. Their temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Their hypertension is treated, and they return 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in their legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in their extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","Given the patient's presentation and clinical findings, there are multiple considerations in their management. The high blood pressure reading (177/118 mmHg) is concerning for severe hypertension, which is a primary issue that needs to be managed aggressively. Additionally, the patient presents with bilateral edema, suggesting possible systemic issues, such as heart failure, renal dysfunction, or liver disease. 

The patient's symptoms of symmetrical pain in the hands with color changes (from red to white to blue) are suggestive of Raynaud's phenomenon, which can occur secondary to various conditions such as connective tissue diseases.

Considering the clinical context, the best next step in management is a comprehensive approach, including:

1. **Address the Hypertension:**
   - Reevaluate and possibly intensify antihypertensive therapy. Severe hypertension can lead to or exacerbate conditions like heart failure, which might explain the edema.
   - Investigate for secondary causes of hypertension, considering the new onset of edema and other systemic symptoms.

2. **Baseline Lab and Diagnostic Tests:**
   - **Complete blood count (CBC)**
   - **Basic metabolic panel (BMP)** to evaluate renal function and electrolytes.
   - **Liver function tests (LFTs)**
   - **Urinalysis** to check for proteinuria or other kidney issues.
   - **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** to assess for any cardiac abnormalities that might be occurring secondary to hypertension.
   - **Chest X-ray** and potentially an **echocardiogram** to evaluate for signs of heart failure given the bilateral edema.
   
3. **Evaluate Raynaud's Phenomenon:**
   - Consider referral to a rheumatologist for further evaluation of underlying connective tissue disease if the Raynaud's phenomenon is confirmed.
   
4. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - Address smoking cessation despite the low number of cigarettes per day.
   - Discuss alcohol use, as two alcoholic beverages per night could have long-term impacts on liver function and hypertension.

Given the bilateral edema and significant hypertension, a thorough cardiovascular evaluation is essential to rule out heart failure. Timely intervention is crucial for managing potential complications and identifying the underlying cause of the symptoms. Hence, these diagnostic steps coupled with an adjustment of antihypertensive treatment and lifestyle interventions represent the best next steps in management.",Lisinopril,Yes
5,"An individual comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. They were diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The patient has a history of systemic sclerosis and presents with symptoms and signs indicative of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a common complication of systemic sclerosis. This condition can lead to elevated pressures in the pulmonary arteries and the right side of the heart, as demonstrated by the cardiac catheterization results.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. The expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in the treatment of PAH is most likely due to its action of increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, which leads to the relaxation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the mechanism:

1. **Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibition**: Tadalafil inhibits the enzyme PDE-5, which is responsible for the breakdown of cGMP.
   
2. **Increased cGMP Levels**: By inhibiting PDE-5, tadalafil leads to increased intracellular levels of cGMP.
   
3. **Vasodilation**: Elevated levels of cGMP promote relaxation of smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation.

4. **Reduction in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance**: This vasodilation effect specifically targets the pulmonary arteries, decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance.

5. **Improved Hemodynamics**: The overall effect is reduced pulmonary arterial pressure and improved blood flow through the lungs, consequently reducing the load on the right side of the heart.

Therefore, the beneficial effect of tadalafil in this context is most likely due to **increasing cGMP in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation and decreased pulmonary arterial resistance**. This helps improve the symptoms and hemodynamics in patients with PAH secondary to systemic sclerosis.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,Yes
6,"An individual is brought to their primary care provider by a parent. They are concerned that the individual's acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over-the-counter products without success. The individual is otherwise healthy and without complaint. They were born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. They are up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. They are having trouble with school and have a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, the individual stands 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members, with inflamed pustular acne on the face, shoulders, and chest. They are otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this individual’s clinical features?","The individual described displays several clinical features that suggest a specific chromosomal abnormality. These features include delayed language development, difficulties in school and behavioral issues, excessive height compared to family members, and severe acne. Given this presentation, the most likely associated karyotype is:

**47,XYY (XYY syndrome)**

XYY syndrome is characterized by the presence of an extra Y chromosome in males and can lead to a variety of physical, developmental, and behavioral challenges. Key features often include:

- Increased height compared to peers and family, often becoming noticeable in childhood or adolescence.
- Learning difficulties, particularly with language and speech delays.
- Behavioral problems, including difficulties with impulse control and a higher likelihood of involvement in antisocial behavior.
- Severe acne, which can be more pronounced due to hormonal influences associated with the extra Y chromosome.

While not all individuals with XYY syndrome will experience every symptom, the combination of significant height, developmental delays, and behavioral issues strongly suggests this karyotype. Thus, **47,XYY** is the most likely karyotype associated with the individual's clinical features.",47 XYY,Yes
7,"An individual presents to their primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss, which began approximately 7-8 years ago. They are able to hear when someone is speaking directly to them; however, they have difficulty understanding what is being said, especially in the presence of background noise. Additionally, they report a steady ringing in both ears and occasional dizziness. Medical history includes three prior episodes of acute otitis media, and family history is notable for a relative being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. Vital signs are a temperature of 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure of 138/88 mmHg, pulse of 14/min, and respirations of 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally in both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this individual's symptoms?","The individual's symptoms and examination findings suggest sensorineural hearing loss rather than conductive hearing loss, despite the family history of cholesteatoma which typically causes conductive hearing loss. The progressively worsening hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy environments, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and occasional dizziness (which suggests possible involvement of the vestibular system) all point towards a sensorineural etiology.

The key examination findings using the tuning fork, particularly the Rinne and Weber tests, support this:
1. **Weber test**: When a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead, sound is heard equally in both ears. This suggests either normal hearing or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
2. **Rinne test**: When the tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal (air conduction) and then on the mastoid process (bone conduction), air conduction being greater than bone conduction is noted, which is typical for normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss.

Given the symptomatology and the clinical findings, the most likely cause of this individual's symptoms is **bilateral sensorineural hearing loss**. This type of hearing loss is often caused by age-related changes (presbycusis), exposure to loud noises, ototoxic medications, or other factors affecting the inner ear or auditory nerve.

### Most Likely Cause:
**Bilateral age-related sensorineural hearing loss (presbycusis)**

This condition fits the individual's clinical presentation better than other differentials considering the gradual onset over years, the impact on understanding speech in noise, and the presence of tinnitus and occasional dizziness.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,No
8,"An individual presents to the office for their annual physical examination with no current complaints. They have a history of smoking but no alcohol or drug use. During a review of systems, they report thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when they cough. A non-contrast CT scan of the chest reveals a 2 cm nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus, prompting further testing to rule out malignancy. The individual is surprised by this news as they have never experienced alarming symptoms. The doctor explains that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease and that it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms. Therefore, individuals with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which concept is being described by the doctor to this individual?","The concept being described by the doctor is **""lead time bias.""** 

Lead time bias occurs when early detection of a disease (such as through screening) is confused with an improvement in survival. Essentially, finding a disease earlier (as through screening) may appear to increase the time a patient survives after diagnosis, without necessarily changing the eventual outcome of the disease. In the context of lung cancer, early screening in individuals with risk factors, such as a history of smoking, can detect the disease before symptoms manifest. However, this does not necessarily mean that the overall prognosis is improved; it just means the diagnosis is made earlier in the disease course. 

The doctor is emphasizing the importance of screening in individuals at high risk (e.g., long-term smokers) to detect potential malignancy earlier than it would be detected based on symptoms alone. This is intended to increase the chances of earlier intervention and potentially better outcomes, even though the early detection itself does not equate to a cure or extended life span without effective treatment.",Latent period,No
9,"An individual comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. They report cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. They claim that this is their 5th episode within the past year and are concerned if “there’s something else going on.” Their medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with an albuterol inhaler. Their laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39 %
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's presentation, which includes recurrent sinus infections, despite controlled asthma, and their laboratory findings, particularly the low levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM), suggest an underlying immunodeficiency. The most likely diagnosis given this context is Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID).

CVID is characterized by markedly reduced levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and/or IgM) and an increased susceptibility to infections, especially sinopulmonary infections. The absence of other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia and the patient's history of frequent infections further supports this diagnosis.

Key points from the patient's presentation that support CVID include:
1. **Recurrent sinus infections**: The patient reports 5 episodes in the past year.
2. **Laboratory findings**:
   - **IgG**: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL) - significantly low
   - **IgA**: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL) - low
   - **IgM**: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL) - low

Given the recurrent infections and the reduction in serum immunoglobulin levels, CVID is the most likely diagnosis. The next steps would include a thorough clinical evaluation to rule out other secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia, possibly genetic testing, and referral to an immunologist for further management. Treatment often involves immunoglobulin replacement therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of infections.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"A patient comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, there has been a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. The patient feels unable to fully empty their bowels. There is no history of serious illness. The patient has a high-fiber diet. One parent is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The patient appears well. Temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's presentation of intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, weight loss, incomplete bowel evacuation, and findings on physical examination and laboratory tests suggest a digestive system disorder. Key features to consider include:

1. **Family History and Genetic Predisposition**: The patient's Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry increases the risk for certain gastrointestinal diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

2. **Chronic Symptoms**: The 4-month history of symptoms along with weight loss points towards a chronic condition rather than an acute one.

3. **Physical and Laboratory Findings**:
   - Mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant.
   - Elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), indicating inflammation.
   - Anemia (hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL).
   - High platelet count (thrombocytosis).
   
4. **Barium Enema Findings**: The presence of ulceration and narrowing in the right colon are significant.

Given these factors, the most likely diagnosis is **Crohn's disease**, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease. This condition often affects the end of the small intestine (ileum) and the beginning of the colon but can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by patchy areas of inflammation, which may cause symptoms like those described.

Crohn's disease can present with:
- Right lower quadrant pain.
- Chronic diarrhea.
- Unintended weight loss.
- Anemia due to intestinal bleeding or malabsorption.
- High ESR and elevated white blood cell count indicating inflammation.
- The endoscopic or radiologic finding of ulcers and narrowing due to transmural inflammation.

Thus, the patient's clinical presentation and investigative findings are highly suggestive of **Crohn's disease**. Further diagnostic evaluations such as endoscopy with biopsy would be essential to confirm this diagnosis and to rule out other conditions.",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a patient is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm3 in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. The patient's temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","In critically ill patients, especially those with significant brain injuries such as this patient who is recovering postoperatively from a craniotomy for epidural hematoma, early initiation of nutritional support is crucial for optimal recovery. This is because nutritional support helps to maintain metabolic function, preserve muscle mass, support immune function, and promote healing.

For this patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) on a ventilator, enteral nutrition (EN) is preferred over parenteral nutrition (PN) if the gastrointestinal tract is functional. Enteral feeding preserves gut integrity and reduces the risk of infections and other complications associated with parenteral nutrition. 

Given the clinical scenario, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition would be **initiating enteral nutrition via a nasogastric or nasoenteric tube**. 

Here are key considerations:
1. **Begin Enteral Nutrition Early**: It is widely recommended to start EN within 24-48 hours in critically ill patients who are unable to maintain adequate oral intake. Early EN has been shown to improve outcomes.
2. **Assess Gastrointestinal Function**: Ensure there are no contraindications to starting enteral feeding such as bowel obstruction, major gastrointestinal bleeding, or severe hemodynamic instability.
3. **Monitor and Adjust**: Start with a low rate of continuous feeding and gradually increase as tolerated. Monitor for signs of feeding intolerance such as high gastric residual volumes, bloating, or diarrhea.

In summary, initiating enteral nutrition, assuming there are no contraindications, is the most appropriate next step in the nutritional management of this patient.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"An individual with developmental delays presents to their pediatrician’s office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of their knees, elbows, and around their eyelids. The patient's caregiver notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since infancy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the patient’s skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in their sweat and urine. Based on the patient's symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","Based on the symptoms and history presented, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Phenylketonuria (PKU)**. PKU is a genetic metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. High levels of phenylalanine can lead to a variety of symptoms including developmental delays, hypopigmentation, and a characteristic musty odor.

Given the diagnosis of PKU, the most appropriate dietary recommendation is:

**A low-phenylalanine diet.**

This involves:

1. **Restricting high-protein foods** such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, nuts, and soy products, which are high in phenylalanine.
2. **Using special low-phenylalanine medical foods and formulas** that provide sufficient nutrition and protein substitutes without high phenylalanine content.
3. Regular monitoring of phenylalanine levels to adjust the diet as needed and ensure appropriate growth and development.

It is crucial for individuals with PKU to follow a strict low-phenylalanine diet throughout their lives to prevent the buildup of phenylalanine and its neurotoxic effects.

Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider specialized in metabolic disorders are also important for ongoing dietary management and overall health.",Avoid meat,Yes
13,A patient presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. This patient has had hypertension for 20 years and is currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"The most likely reason for changes in the left ventricle in a patient with a 20-year history of hypertension is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Hypertension causes the heart to work harder to pump blood against the higher pressure in the arteries. Over time, this increased workload can lead to the thickening of the muscular walls of the left ventricle, a condition known as LVH.

Echocardiography can reveal these changes by showing an increased thickness of the ventricular walls, which is a common adaptation to prolonged high blood pressure. Early detection and management are crucial because LVH is a risk factor for more severe cardiovascular events, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.

Continued management of blood pressure, possibly with adjustments to the anti-hypertensive medications, along with lifestyle modifications, would be essential steps in addressing this condition and preventing further cardiac complications.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"A construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of their skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. They also complain of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. They are a smoker, but recently have grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly.

What is the most common mode of transmission for this individual’s diagnosis?","The patient presents with jaundice, nausea, and loss of appetite, alongside physical findings of mild hepatomegaly, and has a positive anti-HAV IgM antibody, indicating an acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection.

Hepatitis A is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route. This occurs through the ingestion of contaminated food and water. In developed countries, outbreaks can frequently be traced to contaminated food items or poor sanitary conditions. In developing countries, HAV infection is more common and usually occurs in childhood due to widespread contamination of food and water.

Given that the patient is a construction worker, it is possible that they may have been exposed to HAV through contaminated food or water sources on the job site or from unsanitary living conditions if they are living in temporary housing or shared accommodations where hygiene might be compromised.

Hence, the most common mode of transmission for this individual's diagnosis of acute hepatitis A is:

**Ingestion of contaminated food or water.**",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"A child is brought to the clinic for an annual check-up. The family recently moved and is hoping to establish care. The child is home schooled, and the caregiver is concerned about the child's development. The child is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on learning the alphabet."" The caregiver notes that the child always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind."" During the interview, the child is observed to be focused on playing with toys. Physical examination shows a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of the child’s findings?","The child's clinical presentation suggests a diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome. The combination of developmental delay, behavioral issues such as disinterest and poor eye contact, and specific physical features like a prominent jaw, single palmar crease, and enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) are characteristic of this condition.

Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked genetic disorder caused by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. Normally, the FMR1 gene has up to 55 CGG repeats, but in Fragile X syndrome, there are typically more than 200 repeats, leading to excessive methylation and subsequent silencing of the gene. This results in the absence or reduced levels of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which is crucial for normal neural development.

**Summary of Key Points:**

- **Developmental delay**: Difficulty in speech development and learning.
- **Behavioral observations**: Disinterest, poor eye contact.
- **Physical features**: Prominent jaw, single palmar crease, macroorchidism.
- **Genetic mechanism**: CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene leading to gene silencing and deficient FMRP.

Considering the constellation of findings, the most likely mechanism underlying the child’s condition is a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene, leading to Fragile X syndrome.",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"A patient is brought to the emergency department due to a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. They have had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. The patient has gastritis and advanced Parkinson's disease and currently lives in an assisted-living community. They smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. They have a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but have not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. Their temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), they are tachycardic and tachypneic, and their oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
A chest x-ray shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?","This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of aspiration pneumonia, which is supported by the history of a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, tachypnea, hypoxemia, fever, leukocytosis, and a chest x-ray showing infiltrates in the right upper lobe. The most significant predisposing factor in this scenario is the patient's advanced Parkinson's disease.

Individuals with Parkinson's disease often have impaired swallowing and cough reflexes due to the involvement of the cranial nerves and muscles that control these functions. This can lead to an increased risk of aspiration, especially in a patient who may have difficulty managing oral secretions or who could have episodes of choking on food or liquids. Aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents can then lead to aspiration pneumonia.

Additional supporting factors include:
- The advanced stage of Parkinson's disease, which typically involves significant motor dysfunction and possible dysphagia.
- Living in an assisted-living community, where the patient might have less strict monitoring of their eating and drinking habits compared to a hospital setting.

Other factors described in the patient's history that can contribute to respiratory problems, such as a history of smoking and alcohol abuse, may also play a role in the overall respiratory health but are less directly linked to the acute presentation of aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, while relevant, they are not the most significant predisposing factor in this patient's current clinical presentation.

Thus, the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms is **advanced Parkinson's disease**.","Parkinson disease

17,An individual is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this individual?,"The nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles is the median nerve. Damage to the median nerve in the forearm can lead to loss of sensation over specific areas of the hand. The most likely areas affected are:

1. The palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger.
2. The tips of the same fingers on the dorsal side of the hand.

If an individual has damaged the median nerve, they would typically experience sensory loss in these regions. Therefore, loss of sensation over the palmar aspect of the radial hand (including the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring finger) is most likely.",Fingertip of the index finger,Yes
18,"An individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, they received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. Their blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; their vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this individual's increase in creatinine concentration?","The individual's increase in creatinine concentration, along with progressively worsening fatigue, loss of appetite, and normocytic, normochromic anemia, is most likely due to chronic allograft nephropathy. Chronic allograft nephropathy typically manifests years after a kidney transplant and is often characterized by a gradual decline in kidney function, which is reflected in increasing serum creatinine levels.

Given the history of kidney transplantation and the use of immunosuppressive medications (sirolimus and mycophenolate), one important consideration is that chronic rejection or chronic allograft nephropathy could be occurring. Chronic allograft nephropathy involves progressive fibrosis and scarring of the transplanted kidney, leading to a decline in renal function over time.

The patient's elevated blood pressure (150/95 mm Hg) and anemia also support the likelihood of chronic kidney disease. Hypertension is both a cause and a consequence of chronic kidney disease, and anemia is common in chronic renal insufficiency due to decreased erythropoietin production by the failing kidneys.

Thus, the most likely underlying mechanism for the increase in creatinine concentration in this individual is chronic allograft nephropathy. This condition results from a combination of immune-mediated injury, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, and other factors leading to fibrosis and eventual decline in the function of the transplanted kidney.",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,No
19,"An individual with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, they are started on high dose folate supplementation, and their follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. This person is at risk for which long-term complication?","This individual is at risk for long-term complications related to vitamin B12 deficiency. The improvement in anemia and the decrease in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with high-dose folate supplementation suggest that a component of the anemia was responsive to folate. However, this response can mask an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency. 

Vitamin B12 deficiency, if undiagnosed and untreated, can lead to several serious long-term complications, including:

1. **Neurological Complications**: Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which may lead to irreversible nerve damage, including peripheral neuropathy, gait abnormalities, balance issues, and cognitive changes such as memory loss or even dementia.

2. **Hematologic Complications**: Although folate supplementation can temporarily improve hematologic parameters, without correcting the underlying B12 deficiency, the anemia can recur and potentially worsen over time.

3. **Psychiatric Disorders**: Vitamin B12 deficiency can also contribute to psychological and psychiatric conditions, such as depression, mood disorders, and other cognitive impairments.

Given the history of a gastric sleeve operation, which can impair the absorption of vitamin B12 due to reduced gastric acid and intrinsic factor production needed for proper absorption, this individual should have their vitamin B12 levels closely monitored and treated if found deficient. Long-term vitamin B12 supplementation, either through oral high-dose formulations or intramuscular injections, might be necessary to prevent these complications.",Peripheral neuropathy,Yes
