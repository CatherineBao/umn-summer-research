0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, an individual is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless enlargement of their scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for an episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition?","This patient's condition is most consistent with a hydrocele, which is characterized by the painless accumulation of serous fluid within the scrotum. The fact that the scrotum transilluminates (light passes through) is a classic physical examination finding that supports this diagnosis. 

Given the progressive and long-standing nature of the scrotal enlargement along with the setting of southeast Asia, another potential underlying factor to consider could be filariasis, a parasitic infection commonly seen in tropical regions that can lead to lymphatic obstruction and fluid accumulation. Filariasis is caused by nematode worms such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori, which are transmitted by mosquitoes. 

This patient has a significant smoking history and episodic fever, but these factors are less likely related directly to the scrotal enlargement or the underlying mechanism described here. The negative family history for malignancies and inheritable diseases also helps steer away from hereditary conditions or cancer as an immediate concern.

To summarize, the most likely underlying mechanism for this patient's condition, based on the clinical presentation and geography, is lymphatic obstruction potentially due to filariasis, leading to a hydrocele.

Thus, the correct answer that accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition is:

**Lymphatic obstruction due to filarial infection.**",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,No
1,"A G1P1001 individual is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section, which was performed due to breech presentation at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation. The patient is now experiencing purulent discharge, continued heavy bleeding, and difficulty and discomfort with urination. Their prenatal course was complicated by an episode of pyelonephritis, treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the rest of the pregnancy. They have a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, the patient's temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. The exam reveals that the patient is uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and the uterus is slightly boggy and soft with mild tenderness upon manipulation. What is the best next step in management for this condition?","The symptoms and clinical findings in this patient suggest a postpartum infection, potentially endometritis, which is a common cause of infection following a Caesarean section. The presence of fever, tachycardia, purulent lochia, continued heavy bleeding, uterine tenderness, and a boggy uterus are key indicators.

Given that the patient is also experiencing difficulty and discomfort with urination, there is a concern for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), which could also have been precipitated by the earlier episode of pyelonephritis during the prenatal course.

Considering the overall clinical picture, the best next step in management is to:

1. **Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy**: Start empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. A common regimen includes a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin or alternatively ampicillin-sulbactam.

2. **Obtain cultures**: Collect blood cultures, urine cultures, and cultures of the endometrial cavity (if available) to identify the causative organism and tailor antibiotic therapy accordingly once results are available.

3. **Consultation**: Depending on the severity of the symptoms and potential complications, consider consulting with a specialist in Obstetrics/Gynecology or Infectious Disease.

4. **Monitor vital signs and symptoms**: Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs closely, and assess the response to treatment. Regularly check for improvement in fever, uterine tenderness, and lochia characteristics.

5. **Supportive care**: This includes maintaining hydration, managing pain with appropriate analgesics, and addressing any issues related to anxiety with appropriate support or medications if required.

To summarize, immediate initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics while obtaining cultures for targeted therapy is the critical next step in the management of this patient's condition.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy individual is brought to the emergency department after briefly losing consciousness while moving furniture. They were unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness without confusion. The patient did not experience chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. They have had episodes of dizziness when exercising at the gym. Blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

In HCM, the myocardium is abnormally thickened, which can obstruct blood flow out of the heart, particularly during activities that increase heart rate and contractility, such as physical exertion. This can lead to transient decreases in cerebral perfusion and result in syncope or near-syncope.

The key features suggesting HCM in this case include:

1. **Syncope with exertion**: The patient experienced an episode of syncope while moving furniture, which is a form of physical exertion. This is a common presentation for HCM, often exacerbated by activities that increase myocardial contractility.

2. **Systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border**: This is a characteristic location for the murmur of HCM, often described as a harsh crescendo-decrescendo murmur.

3. **Change in murmur with maneuvers**: The murmur associated with HCM typically becomes softer with maneuvers that increase venous return (such as passive leg elevation) or after hydration because these maneuvers increase the left ventricular end-diastolic volume and reduce the degree of outflow obstruction. The disappearance of the murmur with passive leg elevation is consistent with this behavior.

4. **Episodes of dizziness during exercise**: The history of dizziness during exertion is another clue pointing toward HCM, as the increased demand on the heart can precipitate symptoms in individuals with this condition.

The blood pressure and pulse variations while supine and standing are within normal limits, which helps exclude orthostatic hypotension as a cause of the syncope. The absence of chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing makes other acute cardiac events like myocardial infarction or arrhythmias less likely.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's presentation is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"An individual presents for a checkup. They are 20 weeks pregnant and have been admitted to the hospital multiple times during the pregnancy for seizures. They have a known seizure disorder but discontinued their valproic acid when they became pregnant. The patient's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. They do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. They generally prefer not to take medications and typically see a shaman for care. Given the recent hospitalization, the patient agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time?","Given the patient's history of a seizure disorder and recent seizures during pregnancy, it is crucial to manage the seizures effectively while minimizing any potential risks to both the mother and the fetus. Valproic acid is commonly used for seizure control, but it is generally avoided during pregnancy due to its high risk of causing neural tube defects and other congenital malformations.

Carbamazepine is an alternative anticonvulsant that can be used during pregnancy, but it is not without risks. It is associated with a lower incidence of teratogenic effects compared to valproic acid, but it can still cause congenital malformations, including neural tube defects.

Here’s a more comprehensive approach to treatment:

1. **Start Carbamazepine:**
   - Given the patient's willingness to start medication, it is appropriate to start carbamazepine to control her seizures.

2. **Folic Acid Supplementation:**
   - It is crucial to prescribe a high-dose folic acid supplement (4-5 mg daily) because anticonvulsants, including carbamazepine, are associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, and folic acid can help mitigate this risk.

3. **Close Monitoring:**
   - Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's seizure control and adjust medication as necessary.
   - Continuous monitoring of the fetal development through ultrasound and other relevant tests.

4. **Collaboration with a Neurologist and Obstetrician:**
   - Ensuring there is a multidisciplinary team approach to manage both the seizure disorder and the pregnancy.

5. **Shaman Integration:**
   - If the patient prefers seeing a shaman, coordinate care with the patient’s shaman (as long as it does not interfere with medical treatment) to respect her preferences and maintain her comfort.

**Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time is starting carbamazepine along with high-dose folic acid supplementation and ensuring close monitoring and multidisciplinary management.**",Folate,Yes
4,"A person presents to their primary care physician for an annual checkup. They state that they feel well and have no complaints. They live alone and work as a banker. They smoke 1 cigarette per day and drink 2 alcoholic beverages per night. They occasionally get symmetrical pain in their hands where they change from red to white to blue then return to normal again. Their temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and they return 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in their legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in their extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","Given the patient's presentation, chief complaints, and physical examination findings, the differential diagnosis is broad, but it is essential to consider a systemic condition that may account for both hypertension and bilateral edema along with other symptoms. The phenomena of episodic color changes in the hands are suggestive of Raynaud's phenomenon, which can be associated with connective tissue diseases.

Given the bilateral edema, recent management of hypertension, and Raynaud's phenomenon, a systemic evaluation is warranted. It is critical to investigate for potential underlying causes that could range from heart failure, renal issues, liver disease, to connective tissue disorders such as systemic sclerosis.

**Best next step in management:**

1. **Further Laboratory Evaluation:**
   - **Basic Metabolic Panel:** To assess renal function and electrolytes.
   - **B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP):** To evaluate for heart failure.
   - **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** To check for liver-related edema causes.
   - **Autoimmune Panel including ANA (Antinuclear Antibody):** Considering Raynaud's phenomenon, to screen for autoimmune or connective tissue disease.

2. **Imaging Studies:**
   - **Echocardiogram:** To assess cardiac function, given the potential heart failure suggested by bilateral edema.
   - **Chest X-ray:** To check for signs of heart failure or other chest pathology.

3. **Continued Monitoring and Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - Advise the patient to stop smoking and to limit alcohol intake, as both can exacerbate hypertension and overall health.
   - Encourage dietary modifications, such as reducing salt intake to help manage blood pressure and edema.

Regular follow-up should be maintained to monitor the patient’s symptoms, response to treatment, and any progression of underlying conditions. If heart failure or significant renal/liver dysfunction is detected, appropriate specialist referral (cardiology, nephrology, hepatology) may also be necessary.

**In summary, the best next step in management would be targeted laboratory tests (BMP, BNP, LFTs, ANA) and an echocardiogram.** These investigations can help pinpoint the underlying cause of the presented symptoms, guiding further treatment decisions.",Lisinopril,No
5,"An individual comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. They were diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The individual described has systemic sclerosis and is exhibiting signs and symptoms suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a known complication of systemic sclerosis, leading to progressive shortness of breath, and is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressures, as demonstrated by their mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg.

The treatment with tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, is aimed at addressing this condition. The expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in this setting is most likely due to its ability to:

**Inhibit the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).**

Here's how it works:

1. **Nitric Oxide Pathway Activation**: Nitric oxide (NO) is produced in the endothelium of the pulmonary vasculature and diffuses into the smooth muscle cells, where it stimulates the enzyme guanylate cyclase.
   
2. **Increase in cGMP Levels**: Guanylate cyclase converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is a second messenger that promotes smooth muscle relaxation.

3. **Vasodilation**: Elevated levels of cGMP lead to the relaxation of the smooth muscle in the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in vasodilation and reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance.

4. **Inhibition of cGMP Breakdown**: Tadalafil, as a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, prevents the breakdown of cGMP, thereby prolonging its vasodilatory effect.

By inhibiting PDE-5, tadalafil enhances the vasodilatory effects of cGMP, leading to improved blood flow in the pulmonary arteries and reduced pulmonary artery pressure, which alleviates symptoms of PAH.

So, the primary mechanism through which tadalafil provides its beneficial effects in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension is by inhibiting the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), thereby promoting pulmonary vasodilation and reducing pulmonary arterial pressure.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,No
6,"An individual is brought to their primary care provider by a parent. They are concerned that the individual’s acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over-the-counter products without success. The individual is otherwise healthy and without complaints. They were born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and are up to date on all vaccines, although there was some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. They are having trouble with school and have a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, the individual stands 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members, with inflamed pustular acne on their face, shoulders, and chest. They are otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this individual’s clinical features?","The clinical features described in this scenario, including tall stature, inflamed pustular acne, learning and behavioral difficulties, best align with **47,XYY** karyotype. 

Individuals with 47,XYY syndrome typically are noticeably taller than their peers. They might have some degrees of learning difficulties and behavioral issues, which could explain the delayed language development and trouble at school. Acne can also be more severe in these individuals.

Thus, the most likely karyotype associated with the described clinical features is:
- **47,XYY**",47 XYY,Yes
7,"An individual presents to their primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. They state that the trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. They can hear when someone is speaking to them; however, they have difficulty understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to the current symptoms, they report a steady ringing in both ears, and at times experience dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for a parent being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. Their temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally in both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","The patient's presentation of progressively worsening hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments, tinnitus, and episodic dizziness suggests the possibility of sensorineural hearing loss. The tuning fork tests provide further clues:
 
1. **Weber Test (forehead)**: Sound appreciated equally in both ears suggests either normal hearing or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
2. **Rinne Test**: Air conduction greater than bone conduction (Rinne positive) suggests sensorineural hearing loss as well if it is consistent across both ears.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is **presbycusis** (age-related hearing loss). Presbycusis is a common cause of sensorineural hearing loss in older adults and fits the described pattern of difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy environments, and gradual hearing loss over several years.

**To summarize:**

- **Progressively worsening hearing loss**: Consistent with a chronic and progressive condition.
- **Difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments**: Typical of sensorineural hearing loss.
- **Tinnitus and episodic dizziness**: Often associated with inner ear pathology or age-related degenerative changes.
- **Tuning Fork Tests (Weber and Rinne)**: Indications are more typical of sensorineural hearing loss rather than conductive hearing loss.
- **Family history of cholesteatoma**: A history of cholesteatoma in the family is noted but does not directly correlate with sensorineural loss indicated by Rinne and Weber tests.

Given these considerations, presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) is most likely the cause of the patient’s symptoms.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,No
8,"An individual presents to the office for their annual physical examination. They have no current complaints, and past medical history is unremarkable. They report a 30-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or drug use. The review of systems is only notable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when they cough. A non-contrast CT scan of their chest is performed, and the doctor informs them that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in their upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The individual is surprised by this news since they have never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs them that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease. The doctor says that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms, which is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this individual?","The concept being described by the doctor to this individual is the ""lead-time bias."" Lead-time bias occurs when early detection of a disease (such as through screening) appears to increase survival time, but what is actually increased is the time knowing about the disease, not the actual survival time. The individual may be diagnosed with the disease earlier, but the natural progression and eventual outcome of the disease are not affected by the earlier diagnosis. 

In the context of the patient's situation, the doctor is explaining that lung cancers can be asymptomatic for a long period, and screening allows for earlier detection which might seemingly extend the time patients live with the diagnosis but does not necessarily change the ultimate prognosis. Early detection through screening in high-risk individuals, such as long-term smokers, aims to identify malignancies at a potentially more treatable stage, which can improve outcomes but also introduces the concept of lead-time bias.",Latent period,No
9,"A patient comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. They report cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. They mention this is their 5th episode within the past year and are concerned if “there’s something else going on.” Their medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with an albuterol inhaler. Their laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39 %
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's recurrent sinus infections and the specific pattern of laboratory findings suggest an underlying immunodeficiency. Their history of recurrent infections (5 episodes in the past year), coupled with low levels of multiple immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM), most likely indicates **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**.

CVID is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins and an increased susceptibility to infections. The diagnosis is often considered when patients have recurrent infections involving the sinuses, lungs, and other areas, and when laboratory tests show low levels of at least two types of immunoglobulins, typically IgG along with either IgA or IgM.

In this patient, the IgA, IgG, and IgM levels are all below the normal range, which aligns with the typical diagnostic criteria for CVID. Additional diagnostic steps may include assessments of vaccine response to determine the functional capacity of the humoral immune system and ruling out secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia.

Management typically involves immunoglobulin replacement therapy, which can help reduce the frequency of infections and improve quality of life.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, CVID is the most likely diagnosis for this patient. Further evaluation by an immunologist would be warranted for confirmation and to guide appropriate management.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"An individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, they have had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. They feel like they cannot fully empty their bowels. They have no history of serious illness. They have a high-fiber diet. One of their parents is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. They appear well. Their temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Their hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's presentation, including the 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, significant weight loss, inability to fully empty the bowels, mild right lower quadrant tenderness, elevated leukocyte count, elevated platelet count, anemia, and a significantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), is suggestive of an inflammatory process. Furthermore, the findings on barium enema of ulceration and narrowing of the right colon reinforce this.

Given these symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Crohn's disease**. 

Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus, but most commonly it affects the end of the small bowel and the beginning of the colon. It is characterized by inflammation that can penetrate deep into affected tissues, causing symptoms like abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. 

The patient's Ashkenazi Jewish descent and the right lower quadrant tenderness, along with the specific pattern of bowel involvement seen on imaging, further increases the likelihood of Crohn's disease, as this population has a higher prevalence of this condition.

## Key Features Suggesting Crohn's Disease:
1. Chronic intermittent abdominal pain and cramping, especially in the right lower quadrant.
2. Diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating and nausea.
3. Anemia (hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL).
4. Leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 12,000 mm³).
5. Thrombocytosis (platelet count of 480,000 mm³).
6. Significantly elevated ESR (129 mm/h), indicating active inflammation.
7. Barium enema showing ulceration and narrowing of the right colon.
8. Weight loss.
9. Higher prevalence in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

By contrast, ulcerative colitis typically affects the rectum and may extend continuously to involve more of the colon, and it generally does not cause the patchy, transmural inflammation seen in Crohn's disease. The absence of blood in stool and the distinct imaging findings on the barium enema make Crohn's disease the more likely diagnosis in this case.",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a patient is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm3 in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. The temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","In managing the nutrition of a critically ill patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively, particularly after a significant trauma such as an epidural hemorrhage with craniotomy, it is important to initiate appropriate nutritional support as soon as the patient is stabilized. Given the clinical scenario, where the patient is on mechanical ventilation and has undergone major surgery, the most appropriate next step is to begin **early enteral nutrition**.

### Early Enteral Nutrition:
- **Enteral Feeding (via Nasogastric or Orogastric Tube):** This is the preferred method as it preserves gut integrity, prevents bacterial translocation, and is associated with fewer complications compared to parenteral nutrition. Start with a tube feeding regimen and advance as tolerated.
  
- **Timing:** Early enteral nutrition is generally recommended within the first 24-48 hours after ICU admission if the patient is hemodynamically stable. Your patient has stable vital signs, which indicates that it is appropriate to start enteral feeding.

### Steps to Initiate Enteral Nutrition:
1. **Insert a Feeding Tube:** Insert a nasogastric or orogastric tube for enteral nutrient delivery.
2. **Assess Tolerance:** Start with a low infusion rate and monitor for tolerance, which includes checking for gastric residual volumes, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal distension.
3. **Gradual Advancement:** Gradually increase the feeding rate as tolerated by the patient and according to institutional protocols.

### Monitoring and Adjustments:
- **Nutritional Needs:** Calculate the patient’s caloric needs factoring in their hypermetabolic state due to trauma and postoperative status.
- **Adjust based on Response:** Monitor the patient's response to enteral nutrition, adjusting the formula and rate as required.

### Avoiding Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Initially:
- **TPN for Specific Indications:** Total parenteral nutrition should typically be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition or have contraindications to enteral feeding. It is associated with a higher risk of complications such as infections and should be avoided if the gut is functional.

Given the information, the best approach would be to start **enteral feeding through a feeding tube**. This method supports the patient’s nutrition while using the least invasive and risk-laden approach available for critically ill patients.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"An individual with developmental delays presents to a healthcare provider's office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of their knees, elbows, and around their eyelids. The individual’s guardian notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since infancy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the individual's skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in their sweat and urine. Based on the individual's symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","Based on the presentation of the individual with developmental delays, itchy rash on flexor surfaces, hypopigmentation, and a musty odor in sweat and urine, the most likely diagnosis is **phenylketonuria (PKU)**. PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the body.

The appropriate dietary recommendation for an individual with PKU is a **diet low in phenylalanine**. This includes:

1. **Avoiding high-protein foods** such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, nuts, and soybeans, as these are high in phenylalanine.
2. **Special medical formulas** and foods that are low in phenylalanine, specifically designed for individuals with PKU, should be included in the diet to ensure adequate nutrition.

Effective management of PKU involves regular monitoring of phenylalanine levels and strict adherence to a low-phenylalanine diet to prevent neurological damage and other complications associated with the disorder. It is also important for the healthcare provider to involve a dietitian who specializes in metabolic disorders to develop a tailored nutritional plan for the individual.",Avoid meat,Yes
13,An individual presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. The person has had hypertension for 20 years and is currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"Given the patient's long history of hypertension and the fact that they are still experiencing elevated blood pressure despite multiple anti-hypertensive medications, the most likely reason for the changes observed in the left ventricle on the echocardiography is **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**. 

Long-standing hypertension increases the workload on the heart, particularly the left ventricle, which must pump blood against higher systemic pressures. Over time, this results in the thickening of the myocardial walls of the left ventricle as the muscle fibers enlarge to cope with the increased demand. This condition is known as left ventricular hypertrophy.

LVH can be identified on echocardiography by increased left ventricular wall thickness and mass. While LVH can initially be an adaptive response to sustain cardiac output under increased pressure, it may eventually lead to diastolic dysfunction, decreased coronary artery perfusion reserve, and an increased risk of cardiac events like heart failure, arrhythmia, and ischemia.

Continued management of hypertension with effective control of blood pressure is crucial to prevent further progression of LVH and associated complications.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"An individual presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. They also complain of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. They are a smoker but recently have grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this diagnosis?","The individual in this case presents with signs and symptoms indicative of acute viral hepatitis, characterized by yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice), nausea, and loss of appetite. The patient's hepatitis viral panel reveals positivity for Anti-HAV IgM, which is a marker for acute Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) infection.

Hepatitis A is typically transmitted via the fecal-oral route. The most common modes of transmission for Hepatitis A include:

1. Consumption of contaminated food or water.
2. Close personal contact with an infected person.
3. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices.

Given the information and the positivity for Anti-HAV IgM, the most common mode of transmission for this diagnosis (acute Hepatitis A) is via the fecal-oral route.",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"A patient is brought to the clinic by a parent for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is home schooled and the parent is concerned about the child's development. The child is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on the alphabet."" The child always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind.” The patient is observed to be focused on playing with cars during the interview. Physical examination demonstrates a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The patient's clinical presentation and physical findings are suggestive of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including cognitive impairment and learning disabilities. The key features pointing towards FXS in this child include:

1. Developmental delay, particularly in speech (speaking only 2-3 word sentences).
2. Behavioral characteristics (appears disinterested, poor eye contact, intense focus on specific objects like cars).
3. Physical features such as a prominent jaw and enlarged testicles (macroorchidism).
4. A single palmar crease, which is less specific but can sometimes be seen in various genetic conditions.

The most likely mechanism of these findings in Fragile X syndrome is the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome. In individuals with Fragile X syndrome, there is an abnormal increase in the number of CGG repeats in this gene. Normally, the FMR1 gene has between 5 and 44 CGG repeats, but in individuals with Fragile X syndrome, the number of repeats is greater than 200. This leads to hypermethylation of the FMR1 gene, which in turn silences the gene, preventing it from producing the functional Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) that is necessary for normal neural development.

The lack of FMRP disrupts synaptic development and plasticity, leading to the developmental delays, cognitive impairment, and the physical and behavioral characteristics seen in Fragile X syndrome.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism for this patient's findings is **CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene**.",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"An individual is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. They have had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. The individual has gastritis as well as advanced Parkinson disease and currently lives in an assisted-living community. They smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. They have a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but have not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. Their temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), they are tachycardic and tachypneic, and their oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
A chest x-ray shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this individual's respiratory symptoms?","The individual's respiratory symptoms, characterized by a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, and a chest X-ray showing infiltrates in the right upper lobe, suggest that they have developed a pulmonary infection, most likely aspiration pneumonia. Several factors in this individual's history could predispose them to such an infection, but the most significant predisposing factor in this case is:

**Advanced Parkinson disease**

Advanced Parkinson's disease can significantly impair the ability to protect the airway due to:
1. **Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)**: Common in Parkinson's disease, which increases the risk of aspirating food, liquids, or oropharyngeal secretions into the lungs.
2. **Impaired cough reflex**: Reduced ability to clear the respiratory tract, leading to an increased risk of aspiration.
3. **General immobility and muscle rigidity**: Can contribute to poor pulmonary hygiene and increased risk of infections.

Other potential factors like a history of smoking and alcohol abuse, and living in an assisted-living community, might also contribute to the risk, but the advanced Parkinson disease represents the most significant and directly related risk factor in this context, especially given the clinical presentation suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.","Parkinson disease

17,An individual is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this person?,"The nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles in the forearm is the median nerve. Damage to the median nerve at the level of the forearm is most likely to result in loss of sensation as well as motor function.

The areas of sensory loss associated with injury to the median nerve at the forearm level typically include the following:

1. Lateral (radial) aspect of the palm.
2. Palmar surface of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and lateral half of the ring finger.
3. Distal tips of the same fingers on the dorsal side.

These regions correspond to the sensory distribution of the median nerve in the hand. Therefore, loss of sensation over the palmar surface of the lateral three and a half fingers and the corresponding fingertips on the dorsal side is most likely in this person.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- The palmar surface of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and lateral half of the ring finger.",Fingertip of the index finger,No
18,"An individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, they received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. Blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's increase in creatinine concentration?","The individual described in the scenario has a history of a kidney transplant and is presenting with progressively worsening fatigue, loss of appetite, normocytic normochromic anemia, and elevated serum creatinine. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate.

Given that the individual's blood pressure is elevated (150/95 mm Hg) and considering the transplant history, the increased creatinine concentration suggests worsening kidney function, which is a concern in a transplant recipient.

One of the primary underlying mechanisms for this patient's increased creatinine concentration is likely chronic allograft nephropathy (also known as chronic rejection). Chronic allograft nephropathy is characterized by a combination of interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomerulopathy, and vascular changes. It can occur months to years post-transplant and gradually reduces kidney function over time.

The usage of immunosuppressive medications like sirolimus and mycophenolate is intended to prevent rejection, but despite this preventive treatment, chronic allograft nephropathy can still occur. Sirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) can also contribute to proteinuria and nephrotoxicity as potential adverse effects, thereby compounding renal function decline.

Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's increased creatinine concentration is:

**Chronic allograft nephropathy (chronic rejection).**

It is important for the patient to undergo further evaluation and management by their nephrologist or transplant specialist to address this potential issue, adjust immunosuppressive therapy if necessary, and manage any complications to optimize kidney function and overall health.",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,No
19,"An individual with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, they are started on high dose folate supplementation, and their follow-up labs show a hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. They are at risk for which long-term complication?","The individual's history of gastric sleeve surgery and the lab findings suggest that they may have had a deficiency in folate, which has been addressed with folate supplementation. However, gastric sleeve surgery, which reduces the size of the stomach and limits nutrient absorption, can put patients at risk for other deficiencies, particularly Vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to a condition called ""subacute combined degeneration"" of the spinal cord, which affects both the myelin (protective sheath) of the nerves and the spinal cord itself. This condition can cause long-term neurological complications including:

1. **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Damage to peripheral nerves can cause symptoms such as tingling, numbness, and weakness, typically starting in the hands and feet.
2. **Balance and Coordination Problems:** Due to damage in the spinal cord affecting proprioceptive pathways, patients can experience difficulty walking and maintaining balance.
3. **Cognitive Changes:** Severe and prolonged B12 deficiency can lead to cognitive impairments and even dementia.

Given the reduction in MCV (mean corpuscular volume) following folate supplementation, the individual's macrocytic anemia has improved, suggesting folate deficiency was a contributing factor. However, without addressing the potential Vitamin B12 deficiency, the individual remains at risk for the aforementioned neurological complications.

To mitigate these risks, it's important that the patient's vitamin B12 levels are monitored and managed, potentially with supplementation if a deficiency is detected. Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider for comprehensive nutritional monitoring is crucial, especially following bariatric surgeries that affect nutrient absorption.",Peripheral neuropathy,Yes
