0,"A 73-year-old individual noted a rapid onset of severe dizziness and difficulty swallowing while watching TV at home. Their partner reports that they had difficulty forming sentences and their gait was unsteady at this time. Symptoms were severe within 1 minute and began to improve spontaneously after 10 minutes. They have had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 25 years and have a 50 pack-year smoking history. On arrival to the emergency department 35 minutes after the initial development of symptoms, their manifestations have largely resolved with the exception of a subtle nystagmus and ataxia. Their blood pressure is 132/86 mm Hg, heart rate is 84/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. After 45 minutes, their symptoms are completely resolved, and a neurological examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this individual’s condition?","The symptoms described in this 73-year-old individual are most suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is characterized by a brief episode of neurological dysfunction resulting from a temporary lack of blood flow to a particular area of the brain, spinal cord, or retina, without the evidence of acute infarction on subsequent imaging.

Key points supporting TIA in this case include:

1. **Sudden Onset of Neurological Symptoms**: The rapid onset of severe dizziness, difficulty swallowing, difficulty forming sentences, and unsteady gait are all indicative of a possible cerebrovascular event.
2. **Transient Nature**: The symptoms were acute and reached maximum severity within one minute, then spontaneously began to improve, with complete resolution of symptoms within an hour.
3. **Residual Signs**: Although most symptoms resolved, there was a subtle nystagmus and ataxia on examination initially, suggesting a transient brainstem or cerebellar involvement.
4. **Risk Factors**: The individual has multiple risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, including long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and a significant smoking history (50 pack-years).

The combination of transient neurological symptoms and risk factors strongly points to a TIA, which requires prompt medical evaluation and management to prevent potential future strokes.

In summary, the rapid onset, nature, and spontaneous resolution of symptoms, along with the risk profile, align with a diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA).",Vertebral artery occlusion,No
1,"A 27-year-old individual with a history of injection drug use has been feeling short of breath and fatigued for the past several weeks. They are having trouble climbing the stairs to their apartment and occasionally feel like their heart is racing out of control. Their past medical history is most notable for a previous bout of infective endocarditis after which they were lost to follow-up. On exam, you note that their carotid pulse has rapid rise and fall. Which of the following would you also expect to find?","Given the patient's history of injection drug use and past infective endocarditis, along with the rapid rise and fall of the carotid pulse (suggestive of a hyperdynamic circulation), it is reasonable to consider that they might have developed a valvular heart condition, particularly aortic regurgitation (AR). Aortic regurgitation can cause a hyperdynamic circulation due to the increased stroke volume as blood flows back into the left ventricle during diastole.

In this context, you might also expect to find:

### Physical Exam Findings:
- **Widened Pulse Pressure:** This is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A widened pulse pressure is often seen in chronic severe AR due to the increased stroke volume (leading to higher systolic pressure) and rapid runoff of blood back into the left ventricle (leading to lower diastolic pressure).
- **""Water-hammer"" Pulse (Corrigan’s Pulse):** This is a bounding and forceful pulse with a rapid upstroke and collapse, often seen in severe AR.
- **Diastolic Murmur:** A high-pitched, blowing diastolic murmur heard best along the left sternal border when the patient is sitting up, leaning forward, and exhaling.
- **Quincke's Sign:** Capillary pulsations visible at the fingertips or over the nail bed.
- **Musset's Sign:** Head nodding that occurs with each heartbeat.
- **Duroziez’s Sign:** A systolic and diastolic bruit heard over the femoral artery when it is compressed.

### Other Possible Findings:
- **Fatigue and Weakness:** Due to decreased effective forward cardiac output.
- **Dyspnea on Exertion:** Due to pulmonary congestion as a result of fluid backing up into the lungs.
- **Palpitations:** Due to increased stroke volume and possibly associated arrhythmias.
- **Signs of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy or Heart Failure:** Peripheral edema, jugular venous distention (JVD), or significant pulmonary rales could suggest more advanced disease.

Given these findings, the diagnosis of aortic regurgitation would need to be confirmed with echocardiography, which would show the extent of the regurgitation and the condition of the valves. This diagnostic step is crucial for further management, which could include medical therapy or surgical intervention depending on the severity of the regurgitation and the symptoms.

",Widened pulse pressure,Yes
2,"A 4-year-old child is brought to the emergency room by a parent after the child was bitten by a rattlesnake one hour prior to presentation. The child was reportedly playing in the backyard alone when the parent heard the child scream. The parent rushed out to the child and found a snake with a rattle on its tail slithering away from the child. On examination, the child has a bleeding bite mark and significant swelling over the dorsal aspect of the right hand. The child is in visible distress and appears pale and diaphoretic. The child undergoes fluid resuscitation and is placed on supplemental oxygen. The child is administered rattlesnake antivenom and is admitted for observation. The child is subsequently discharged 24 hours later feeling better. However, 6 days after admission, the child presents again to the emergency department with a temperature of 102°F (38.9°C), diffuse wheals, and knee and hip pain. This patient’s condition is caused by which of the following?","The patient’s symptoms 6 days after the rattlesnake bite and treatment with antivenom are indicative of serum sickness—a type III hypersensitivity reaction. Serum sickness can occur after the administration of antivenom, which is often derived from animal sources.

Serum sickness typically manifests with fever, rash (such as urticaria or diffuse wheals), and polyarthralgia (pain in multiple joints) approximately 1-2 weeks after exposure to the offending agent. The immune system reaction involves the formation of immune complexes, which deposit in various tissues and incite an inflammatory response.

The key points indicating serum sickness in this patient include:
- Onset of symptoms (fever, diffuse wheals, joint pain) several days after initial treatment with antivenom.
- The use of antivenom, which is known to potentially cause serum sickness.

Thus, the condition is caused by a type III hypersensitivity reaction to the rattlesnake antivenom.",Antibody-antigen complex deposition,Yes
3,"A 22-year-old individual is brought to the emergency department by campus police for bizarre behavior. They were arrested while trying to break into their university's supercomputer center and were found crying and claiming they need access to the high-powered processors immediately. Their significant other arrived at the hospital and reports that, over the past week, they have been staying up all night working on 'various projects’. A review of their electronic medical record reveals that they were seen at student health 1 week ago for low energy and depressed mood, for which treatment was started. In the emergency department, they continue to appear agitated, pacing around the room and scolding staff for stopping them from their important work. Their speech is pressured, but they exhibit no evidence of visual or auditory hallucinations. The physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following medications most likely precipitated this individual's event?","The scenario described suggests a possible case of medication-induced mania. The patient initially presented with low energy and depressed mood, for which they were treated, and now they exhibit symptoms suggestive of mania, such as agitation, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, grandiose delusions, and increased activity directed toward goal completion.

Given this clinical picture, the medication most likely responsible is an **antidepressant**. Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), can sometimes precipitate mania or hypomania in individuals, especially those who may have an underlying bipolar disorder which had not yet been diagnosed.

Possible medications that could have precipitated this event include:

- **Fluoxetine (Prozac)**
- **Sertraline (Zoloft)**
- **Citalopram (Celexa)**
- **Escitalopram (Lexapro)**
- **Venlafaxine (Effexor)**
- **Duloxetine (Cymbalta)**

Furthermore, the fact that the individual was recently started on treatment and now presents with markedly different symptoms (consistent with mania) strongly suggests that the medication prescribed for their depressive symptoms (which is likely an antidepressant) is the precipitant.

This case underscores the importance of careful monitoring for mood changes in patients starting on antidepressants and the need for a thorough psychiatric evaluation to rule out bipolar disorder before initiating antidepressant therapy in individuals with depressive symptoms.",Sertraline,Yes
4,"A 67-year-old individual presents to the emergency department following an episode of chest pain and a loss of consciousness. The patient is in critical condition and their vital signs are rapidly deteriorating. It is known that the patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The patient is accompanied by a spouse, who wants the medical staff to do everything to resuscitate and bring the patient back. The patient also has 2 children, who are on their way to the hospital. The patient's written advance directive states that they do not wish to be resuscitated or have any sort of life support. Which of the following is the appropriate course of action?","In this situation, the patient's advance directive should be honored. Advance directives are legal documents that express a patient's preferences regarding medical treatment in situations where they are no longer able to communicate their decisions. These documents are designed to guide healthcare providers and ensure that the patient's wishes are respected.

Here is the rationale behind this decision:

1. **Respect for Autonomy**: The principle of respect for autonomy requires that a patient's informed and expressed wishes be honored. The directive explicitly states the patient's desire not to be resuscitated or placed on life support.

2. **Legal and Ethical Obligation**: Legally, healthcare providers are obligated to follow advance directives, provided they are valid and applicable. Ethically, it is the duty of healthcare professionals to prioritize the patient's instructions as outlined in their advance directive.

3. **Request from the Spouse**: While the spouse’s wishes are important and should be considered, they do not override the patient's clear and documented preferences. The advance directive takes precedence over family requests in such situations.

4. **Family Communication**: It's crucial to communicate compassionately with the spouse and children, explaining the importance of respecting the patient's advance directive. Ensure that they understand the patient's decisions and the legal and ethical obligations to follow those wishes.

Given the above considerations, the appropriate course of action would be:

- **Do not initiate resuscitation or life support measures**, in accordance with the patient's advance directive.
- **Communicate the decision clearly and compassionately** to the spouse and, subsequently, to the arriving children.
- **Provide palliative care and comfort measures** for the patient to ensure they are not suffering, and support the family through this difficult time.

Given the critical nature of the situation, it is also appropriate to involve a hospital ethics committee or legal counsel if there is any dispute or confusion regarding the advance directive, but the default position should be to honor the patient's documented wishes.",Respect the patient’s advance directive orders,Yes
5,"A 26-year-old individual presents to your clinic with complaints of increasing muscle fatigue that worsens after periods of sustained activity. They also report both ptosis and diplopia that make reading in the late afternoon and evenings difficult. An edrophonium test is performed and is positive, demonstrating resolution of the patient's weakness. One organ in particular, when abnormal, is associated with this patient's condition. Which of the following embryologic structures gives rise to this organ?","The clinical presentation of muscle fatigue, ptosis, diplopia, and a positive edrophonium test is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is often associated with abnormalities of the thymus gland. In a significant number of cases, patients with myasthenia gravis may have thymic hyperplasia or a thymoma.

The thymus is derived from the embryologic third pharyngeal pouch. The third pharyngeal pouch gives rise to both the thymus and the inferior parathyroid glands.

Therefore, the embryologic structure that gives rise to the organ associated with this patient's condition (the thymus) is:

**Third pharyngeal pouch**",3rd branchial pouch,Yes
6,"A 12-year-old child is brought in by their parents as they are concerned about the child's behavior. The child is constantly arguing with the parents and blatantly defying their every request. In school, the child is known for being intentionally tardy and for defying teachers. Upon further questioning of the patient, you learn about some of the child's recent behaviors such as beginning smoking to bother the parents. You also notice that the child is disrespectful towards you. You then learn that the child has also gotten into weekly fights with peers at school with no apparent cause. In addition, last week the child was seen hitting one of the local neighborhood cats with a baseball bat trying to kill it. The patient lives at home with two parents in a pre-World War II house that was recently renovated. Physical exam is unremarkable.

Laboratory values are as follows:

Na: 140 mmol/L
K: 4.5 mmol/L
Cl: 100 mmol/L
Glucose: 80 mg/dL
Ca: 10 mmol/L
Mg: 3 mEq/L
Cr: 0.8 mg/dL

MCV: 95
Urine toxicology: negative

As the patient leaves the office, you notice the child stealing all of the candy from the office candy bowl. The patient seems unconcerned about their behavior overall. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true in this patient?","This child's presenting behaviors are suggestive of a severe conduct disorder (CD). CD is characterized by a persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated. The child exhibits multiple symptoms of CD, such as:

- Aggression towards people and animals (fighting with peers, hitting a cat with a baseball bat).
- Deceitfulness or theft (stealing candy).
- Serious violations of rules (chronic defiance, intentionally tardy, smoking to bother parents).

Given the variety and severity of symptoms, a diagnosis of conduct disorder is likely. The most probable statement regarding this patient is:

**The patient displays a pattern of behavior that is indicative of Conduct Disorder (CD).**

Conduct disorder can be influenced by a variety of factors including genetic, environmental, and social factors. It's important to address these behaviors promptly and intervene with appropriate therapeutic measures, which may include behavioral therapy, family therapy, and possibly medication if indicated for comorbid conditions.

However, it is crucial to conduct a thorough psychosocial evaluation and consider all possible influences, including family dynamics, peer influence, and any history of trauma or abuse. Treatment plans should be comprehensive and tailored to the individual needs of the child and family.",The patient's symptoms could progress to antisocial personality disorder,No
7,"A 3-year-old child is diagnosed with an alpha-gal allergy, also known as mammalian meat allergy (MMA). This condition is mediated by a reaction to the carbohydrate galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose. An experimental treatment has been developed to halt the N-linked oligosaccharide addition that occurs in the synthesis of this compound. Which of the following cellular structures is most likely targeted by this experimental drug?","The condition described, alpha-gal allergy (or mammalian meat allergy), involves a reaction to the carbohydrate galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose. The question focuses on an experimental treatment designed to halt the synthesis of this compound, specifically by interfering with N-linked oligosaccharide addition.

N-linked glycosylation, the process where oligosaccharides are attached to nitrogen (N) atoms on the amino acid asparagine within proteins, primarily takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is further processed in the Golgi apparatus.

Thus, the cellular structure most likely targeted by this experimental drug is the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**, as this is where the initial steps of N-linked glycosylation occur.

To summarize, the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** is the cellular structure most likely targeted by this experimental drug.",Rough endoplasmic reticulum,No
8,"A 40-year-old individual who was previously antisocial, low energy at work, and not keen to attend office parties was arrested and brought to the emergency department after showing up to the office Christmas party out of control. They were noted to be very energetic and irritable. They spent the entire evening hijacking conversations and sharing plans for the company that will save it from inevitable ruin. What other finding are you most likely to observe in this individual’s current condition?","The individual described appears to be exhibiting symptoms characteristic of a manic episode, which is often associated with Bipolar Disorder. Key features of a manic episode can include elevated mood, increased energy, grandiosity, increased talkativeness, and engaging in reckless or inappropriate behavior. Given this context, the most likely observation in this individual’s current condition would be:

**Decreased need for sleep:**
People experiencing mania often feel little to no need for sleep and may go for days without feeling tired.

Additionally, other possible symptoms during a manic episode might include:

- **Rapid speech:** Talking very quickly, often to the point where it is difficult for others to get a word in.
- **Flight of ideas or racing thoughts:** Jumping rapidly from one topic to another.
- **Distractibility:** Attention being easily drawn to irrelevant or unimportant stimuli.
- **Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity:** Possessing an exaggerated sense of one’s abilities or importance.
- **Engagement in high-risk behaviors:** Undertaking actions with potentially serious consequences, such as excessive spending, risky sexual behavior, or impetuous decisions.

If the individual continues to exhibit symptoms characteristic of mania, a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation would be necessary to determine appropriate treatment and to rule out other possible causes of the behavior.",Irresponsibility,No
9,"A 19-year-old student presents to their physician with overall fatigue. They are having a hard time concentrating while studying and feeling tired most of the time. They also have had constipation for more than 3 weeks and rectal bleeding on occasion. They notice they are getting colder and often need to wear warmer clothes than usual for the same weather. On examination, a small nodule around the size of 1cm is palpated in the left thyroid lobule; the gland is nontender. There is no lymphadenopathy. Their vital signs are: blood pressure is 118/75 mm Hg, respirations are 17/min, pulse is 87/min, and temperature is 36.1°C (97.0°F). Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?","Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the best next step is to evaluate the thyroid function. The symptoms described, such as fatigue, poor concentration, constipation, feeling cold, and the presence of a thyroid nodule, suggest the possibility of hypothyroidism. Hence, the most appropriate initial test would be to measure the serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Free Thyroxine (T4) levels.

### Management steps:
1. **Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs)**:
   - **TSH**: The most sensitive marker for thyroid function.
   - **Free T4**: Measures the active form of thyroxine if TSH is abnormal.

### Additional evaluation considerations:
- **Ultrasound of the thyroid gland**: This would help in further characterizing the thyroid nodule detected during physical examination.
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To assess for anemia which could also contribute to fatigue.
- **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)**: To check for any other underlying abnormalities.
- **Stool Occult Blood Test**: Given the history of rectal bleeding, to rule out gastrointestinal pathology.

However, the immediate and most directed next step, considering the constellation of symptoms and the physical exam findings, would be to focus on thyroid function tests. Early identification and management of thyroid dysfunction can significantly improve the patient's symptoms and overall health.

### Summary
The best next step is to **measure serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Free Thyroxine (T4) levels** to evaluate for hypothyroidism. If thyroid function tests indicate hypothyroidism or another thyroid disorder, further management should be aligned accordingly. Simultaneously, addressing rectal bleeding with appropriate investigations is also crucial.",Thyroid ultrasound,No
10,"A 44-year-old individual comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of productive cough, fever, and lethargy. They also have several skin lesions over their body. Symptoms began 3 weeks after returning from a camping trip in Kentucky. Three years ago, they underwent kidney transplantation for polycystic kidney disease. Current medications include sirolimus and prednisone. Their temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Diffuse crackles are heard over the lung fields. There are 4 white, verrucous skin patches over the chest and upper limbs. A photomicrograph of a skin biopsy specimen from one of the lesions is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","Given the clinical presentation and the history, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated blastomycosis.

**Key Points:**
1. **Symptoms and Physical Examination:**
   - The individual has a 3-week history of productive cough, fever, and lethargy.
   - Presence of diffuse crackles over the lung fields, indicating a pulmonary infection.
   - Skin lesions described as white and verrucous.
   
2. **Epidemiological History:**
   - Recent camping trip in Kentucky, an area endemic to Blastomyces dermatitidis.
   - Exposure to a setting conducive to inhaling fungal spores.

3. **Immunosuppression:**
   - History of kidney transplantation and use of immunosuppressive medications (sirolimus and prednisone), which increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections.

4. **Histopathological Findings:**
   - The photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen (though not visible here) likely shows broad-based budding yeast forms that are characteristic of Blastomyces dermatitidis.

**Blastomycosis**:
- It is a fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis.
- Commonly found in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, Great Lakes region, and the southeastern United States.
- It can cause pulmonary infections that can be mistaken for bacterial pneumonia but often involves other organs, including skin, bones, and the genitourinary system.
- The skin involvement in immunocompromised patients often appears as verrucous lesions, which can sometimes resemble squamous cell carcinoma.

**Other Differential Diagnoses (Less Likely in this Context):**
- Coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis could be considered if the history involved travel to areas endemic to these fungi (Southwest U.S. for Coccidioides, Ohio and Mississippi River valleys for Histoplasma), but the clinical lesion descriptions and the geographic location (Kentucky) are more indicative of blastomycosis.
- Cryptococcosis, though it presents in immunocompromised patients, more commonly manifests as meningitis or pulmonary disease, and the histopathological findings and the type of skin lesions described do not match as precisely.

Thus, the combination of the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, travel history, immunocompromised state, and characteristic skin lesions strongly support the diagnosis of disseminated blastomycosis.",Blastomycosis,Yes
11,"A 12-year-old child is brought to the emergency department because of acute onset abdominal pain. On arrival, the child also complains of nausea and shortness of breath in addition to epigastric pain. The child has previously been admitted to the hospital several times for respiratory infections with Pseudomonas species and uses a nebulizer and a chest wall oscillation vest at home. The patient's acute condition is found to be due to premature activation of an enzyme that normally interacts with the brush border. Which of the following describes the activity of this enzyme?","The clinical presentation and history of multiple respiratory infections with Pseudomonas species suggest the child likely has cystic fibrosis (CF). The acute onset of epigastric pain, nausea, and shortness of breath fits the profile for a potential complication of cystic fibrosis, which can include pancreatitis due to premature activation of pancreatic enzymes.

In the context of CF, the enzyme in question is likely trypsinogen, which is an inactive precursor enzyme (zymogen) produced by the pancreas. Under normal conditions, trypsinogen is secreted into the small intestine, where it is activated to trypsin by the enzyme enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase) located in the brush border of the duodenum. Trypsin then goes on to activate other digestive enzymes, facilitating the breakdown of proteins in the small intestine.

In CF, thick mucus obstructs the pancreatic ducts, leading to premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within the pancreas rather than the small intestine. This can cause autodigestion of pancreatic tissue, resulting in acute pancreatitis.

Thus, the activity of the enzyme described in this scenario is the proteolytic activation of zymogens. Specifically:

- **Proteolytic activation of zymogens.**",Activates phospholipase A2,No
12,"An 18-month-old child is presented to the emergency department by their parents due to swelling in the right knee after playing in the park. The parents say there was no obvious injury. After questioning, one parent mentions that a relative had similar problems. The vital signs include heart rate 146/min, respiratory rate 26/min, temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), and blood pressure 90/52 mm Hg. On physical examination, the swelling of the right knee is evident. The rest of the physical findings are unremarkable. The ultrasound is compatible with hemarthrosis of the right knee. The complete blood count (CBC) results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL
Hematocrit 36%
Leukocyte count 7,300/mm³
Neutrophils 45%
Bands 3%
Eosinophils 1%
Basophils 0%
Lymphocytes 44%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 200,000/mm³
The coagulation test results are as follows:
Partial thromboplastin time (activated) 52.0 s
Prothrombin time 14.0 s
Reticulocyte count 1.2%
Thrombin time < 2 seconds deviation from control
What is the most likely diagnosis?","The clinical presentation of an 18-month-old child with knee swelling without a clear history of trauma, coupled with a family history of similar problems, raises suspicion for a bleeding disorder. The laboratory findings are also critical in narrowing down the diagnosis.

Key points from the lab results include:
- Elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 52 seconds (normal range is typically ~25-35 seconds).
- Normal prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time.
- Normal platelet count and other CBC parameters.

The significant elevation in aPTT with normal PT suggests a defect in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, specifically factors VIII, IX, XI, or XII.

Given the family history and the presentation of hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint space), the most likely diagnosis is Hemophilia. Hemophilia is a genetic disorder usually inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which primarily affects males and can present with spontaneous joint bleeds without obvious trauma. 

There are two main types of Hemophilia:
- **Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency)**
- **Hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency)**

Both types would present with a prolonged aPTT and normal PT, consistent with the lab findings.

Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this child is **Hemophilia**. Further specific testing for Factor VIII and Factor IX levels would be required to definitively diagnose and differentiate between Hemophilia A and B.",Hemophilia A,Yes
13,"A 36-year-old individual presents to the physician with a cough accompanied by expectoration and recurrent wheezing for the last 2 years. They state that the symptoms have progressively worsened in severity and frequency over this period. There is no history of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, or high fever. They have been a smoker for the last 5 years. Their environmental history does not suggest increased risk of developing any occupational lung disease, but their house has mold growth in some areas. Their temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate is 80/min, blood pressure is 124/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 22/min. Auscultation of their chest reveals bilateral wheezing in the infrascapular regions. A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of their chest shows widespread abnormally hypoattenuating areas and simplification of lung architecture in both lower lobes. Pulmonary vessels are decreased in number and widely dispersed in both lower lobes. Which of the following tests is most likely to be helpful in the diagnosis of this patient?","Given the presented symptoms and imaging findings, the patient may have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely with features of emphysema. The key test that would be most helpful in diagnosing this condition is **spirometry**. Spirometry can measure the extent of airflow obstruction and help confirm COPD.

The findings suggestive of emphysema on the HRCT, including widespread hypoattenuation and decreased pulmonary vessels, align with the clinical presentation of progressively worsening cough, expectoration, and wheezing, particularly in the context of smoking history.

**Spirometry** would provide specific measurements such as Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), which are used to assess the presence and severity of airflow obstruction. A decreased FEV1/FVC ratio (less than 0.70) after bronchodilator use is indicative of COPD.

Thus, the most appropriate and helpful test for diagnosing this patient is:
- **Spirometry**",Serum α1-antitrypsin level,No
14,"A scientist is studying patients with neuromuscular weakness and discovers a mutation in a plasma membrane ion channel. They think that this mutation may have an effect on the dynamics of action potentials, so they investigate its effect in an isolated neuronal membrane. They find that the ion channel has no effect when potassium, sodium, and calcium are placed at physiological concentrations on both sides of the membrane; however, when some additional potassium is placed inside the membrane, the channel rapidly allows for sodium to enter the membrane. They continue to examine the mutant channel and find that it is more rapidly inactivated compared with the wildtype channel. Which of the following effects would this mutant channel most likely have on the electrical profile of neurons in these patients?","The mutation in the plasma membrane ion channel that shows a dependence on an elevated internal potassium concentration and allows sodium to enter the membrane, combined with its more rapid inactivation, would most likely have the following effect on the electrical profile of neurons in these patients:

**Shortened action potentials with a brief, but pronounced, depolarization phase.**

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Sodium Influx with Elevated Internal Potassium:**
   - The fact that the mutant channel allows sodium to enter the neuron when there is an elevated potassium concentration inside suggests it is a potassium-sensitive sodium channel. Sodium influx typically causes depolarization of the cell membrane.

2. **Rapid Inactivation:**
   - Rapid inactivation of the channel means that the sodium influx is transient. This would lead to a quick depolarization of the neuron, followed by a rapid return to a less depolarized state as the channel inactivates.

3. **Neuronal Action Potential Dynamics:**
   - An action potential consists of rapid depolarization (usually due to sodium influx) followed by repolarization (often due to potassium efflux). In normal conditions, sodium channels open quickly and then inactivate, while potassium channels open to repolarize the membrane.
   - In the case of the mutant channel, the quick inactivation will shorten the duration of the sodium influx, leading to a briefer depolarization phase.
   - Consequently, the overall action potential would be shorter in duration.

Because the abnormal channel allows for s sodium influx specifically when there is high internal potassium, and since it inactivates more rapidly than normal, the neuron's action potentials would have a fast, pronounced initial depolarization followed quickly by a return to repolarization, resulting in the shortened action potentials.

Thus, the **most likely effect** the mutant channel would have on the electrical profile is **shortened action potentials with a steep and rapid depolarization phase** due to the described behavior of the ion channel in the investigation.",Decreased action potential amplitude,No
15,"A 17-year-old presents to their primary care physician for eye pain. The patient states that it has been going on for the past 3 days and has been steadily worsening. They recently suffered a superior orbital fracture secondary to playing football without a helmet that required no treatment other than to refrain from contact sports. The patient's past medical history is non-contributory, and their vitals are within normal limits. Physical exam demonstrates pain and swelling inferior to the patient's eye near the lacrimal duct. When pressure is applied to the area expressible pus is noted. Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","Given the patient’s history and presenting symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is **dacryocystitis**. 

Dacryocystitis is an infection of the lacrimal sac, typically caused by a blockage in the nasolacrimal duct which leads to stagnation and secondary infection. The key clues pointing towards this diagnosis in the case presented include:
- Pain and swelling inferior to the eye near the lacrimal duct,
- Expressible pus upon pressure in the area, indicating infection.

The history of trauma and superior orbital fracture might have contributed to a secondary blockage or infection, further supporting this diagnosis.

Therefore, dacryocystitis fits best with the symptoms and recent medical history described. The patient will require appropriate antibiotic therapy and possibly consultation with an ophthalmologist for further management.",Dacrocystitis,Yes
16,"A 5-year-old child is brought to the emergency department because of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea for 6 days.

Urine dipstick is positive for blood and protein. A blood smear shows schistocytes and normochromic, normocytic cells. In addition to supportive treatment, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?","The clinical presentation of this 5-year-old child, including abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased urination, development of a rash (petechiae), jaundice, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and significant laboratory findings (anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, presence of schistocytes on blood smear, and urine dipstick positive for blood and protein), is highly suggestive of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS).

HUS is a condition typically following an episode of gastroenteritis, often caused by E. coli O157:H7, which produces Shiga toxin. This toxin leads to endothelial injury, particularly in the kidneys, resulting in hemolytic anemia (evidenced by schistocytes), thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.

### Management of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)
The primary treatment for HUS is supportive care, which includes:
1. **Fluid and Electrolyte Management:** Carefully manage the fluid status to avoid both dehydration and fluid overload.
2. **Management of Renal Failure:** Monitor kidney function closely. Depending on the severity of the renal failure, the patient may require dialysis.
3. **Blood Transfusions:** These may be necessary if the patient is significantly anemic or to manage bleeding complications from thrombocytopenia.
4. **Avoidance of Antibiotics and Antidiarrheal agents:** These are generally avoided as they may worsen the condition.

Given the severity of acute kidney injury (with a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL) and the degree of metabolic acidosis (pH 7.0), this patient might benefit from **urgent renal replacement therapy (dialysis)**.

### Most Appropriate Next Step
**Initiate renal replacement therapy (dialysis).**

This is particularly crucial in patients with severe renal impairment, significant fluid overload, persistent hyperkalemia, or severe metabolic acidosis that is not responding to conservative management.

**Therefore, the most appropriate next step in addition to supportive treatment is renal replacement therapy (dialysis)**, under close monitoring of the patient's fluid and electrolyte status and other supportive care measures.",Hemodialysis,Yes
17,"A 19-year-old individual is brought to the emergency room by their parent. They found their child pale, cold to the touch, and collapsed next to their bed earlier this morning. The patient has no previous medical or psychiatric history, but the parent does report that their child has not had their periods for the last 3 months. In the emergency department, the patient is alert and oriented. Their vitals include: blood pressure 80/60 mm Hg supine, heart rate 55/min. On physical examination, the patient appears pale and emaciated. A urine pregnancy test is negative. They are suspected of having an eating disorder. Which of the following treatment options would be contraindicated in this patient?","In this clinical scenario, the patient is presenting with suspected anorexia nervosa, given the history of amenorrhea, significant weight loss, hypotension, bradycardia, and emaciation. When considering treatment options for an eating disorder, especially anorexia nervosa, certain medications and interventions should be avoided due to their potential risks.

One important treatment option that would be contraindicated in this patient is **bupropion**. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is contraindicated in patients with eating disorders due to an increased risk of seizures, which is heightened in individuals with significant electrolyte disturbances, often seen in patients with anorexia nervosa.

Therefore, the treatment option that would be contraindicated in this patient is:

**Bupropion.**

Other treatment options, such as supportive refeeding, psychotherapy, and medications tailored to address potential comorbid conditions (like anxiety or depression with medications that do not significantly lower the seizure threshold), can be considered with careful monitoring for refeeding syndrome and other complications.",Bupropion,Yes
18,A 69-year-old individual with type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Their only medication is metformin. They have tried to lose weight for several years without success. They are 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weigh 110 kg (243 lb); BMI is 39 kg/m2. Their hemoglobin A1c is 8.5%. Which of the following is the most appropriate antidiabetic drug to address both this patient's glucose control and weight?,"For a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus who is currently on metformin, has a high body mass index (BMI), and has not been successful in losing weight, the most appropriate antidiabetic drug to consider adding to their regimen is **a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist**. Medications in this class, such as liraglutide or semaglutide, not only help with better glucose control but also have a beneficial effect on weight loss.

GLP-1 receptor agonists work by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing inappropriate glucagon release, and slowing gastric emptying, which leads to increased satiety and reduced food intake. Studies have shown that these medications can result in significant reductions in both hemoglobin A1c and body weight, making them a suitable option for a patient with the characteristics described.

To summarize, the most appropriate addition to this patient's current treatment would be:

**GLP-1 receptor agonist (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide)**

This approach addresses both the need for improved glucose control and the desire for weight loss, thereby potentially improving overall metabolic health outcomes for the patient.",Liraglutide,Yes
19,"A 13-year-old child is brought to the physician because of bleeding from their lips earlier that day. They have a history of recurrent nosebleeds since childhood. Their parent has a similar history of recurrent nosebleeds. The child is at the 60th percentile for height and weight. Examination shows multiple, small dilated capillaries over the lips, nose, and fingers. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following conditions is this patient at increased risk for?","The clinical features described—recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis), a family history of the same, and the presence of multiple small dilated capillaries (telangiectasias) over the lips, nose, and fingers—are strongly suggestive of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. 

Patients with HHT are at increased risk for several complications, including:

1. **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Telangiectasias can also occur in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to chronic blood loss and iron deficiency anemia.

2. **Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)**: These can lead to hypoxemia, paradoxical embolism, and brain abscesses due to right-to-left shunting of blood.

3. **Cerebral vascular malformations**: These can increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

4. **Hepatic AVMs**: These can lead to high-output heart failure due to significant shunting of blood.

Given the symptoms described, especially the recurrent nosebleeds and visible telangiectasias, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia is the most likely diagnosis, and hence, the patient is at increased risk for these associated complications.",High-output cardiac failure,Yes
