0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, a 42-year-old person is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless enlargement of their scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition?","The patient's clinical presentation, characterized by a long history of progressive, painless scrotal enlargement with transillumination, episodic fevers, and a lack of significant family history of malignancies or inheritable diseases, suggests a condition such as hydrocele, possibly secondary to filariasis, which is common in Southeast Asia.

Given the geographical context and clinical signs, the underlying mechanism of the patient's condition is most likely:

**B. Lymphatic obstruction due to infection with Wuchereria bancrofti.**

Filariasis is a parasitic infection caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, which is transmitted by mosquito bites. The adult worms live in the lymphatic system and can cause lymphatic obstruction, leading to lymphedema and hydrocele. The episodic fever episodes described might correlate with acute inflammatory episodes associated with filarial infections.

To summarize, the features of the patient’s presentation (painless scrotal enlargement, transillumination, episodic fever, and the geographical context of Southeast Asia) strongly point to a lymphatic filariasis infection causing a hydrocele due to lymphatic obstruction.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,No
1,"A 27-year-old G1P1001 is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section. The surgery was indicated for breech presentation of the infant. The patient was at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation at the time of delivery. The patient is now complaining of purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding. They also note difficulty and discomfort with urination. The patient's prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis, which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. The patient has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, their temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. An exam reveals that the patient is uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Their lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and their uterus is slightly boggy and soft. There is mild tenderness with uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this patient's condition?","This patient presents with symptoms that strongly suggest a postpartum uterine infection (postpartum endometritis). Postpartum endometritis is characterized by fever, uterine tenderness, and lochia that may be foul-smelling or purulent. In this case, the patient has:

- Fever (101.2°F or 38.4°C)
- Purulent, heavy lochia with blood clots
- A boggy and slightly tender uterus
- Prior risk factor such as a history of pyelonephritis, recent Caesarean delivery, and prolonged rupture of membranes (potentially)

Given these clinical features, the **best next step in management** is to initiate broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The most commonly recommended regimen is **clindamycin plus gentamicin** or **ampicillin/sulbactam**. For patients who had a C-section, adding anaerobic coverage with clindamycin is crucial.

Therefore, the best next step in management is:

**Administer intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics.**

Appropriate antibiotic therapy often includes:

- **Clindamycin plus gentamicin**: Clindamycin covers anaerobes and Gram-positive bacteria, while gentamicin covers Gram-negative bacteria.
- Alternately, combinations like **ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole** or **ampicillin/sulbactam** may also be used depending on local antibiotic susceptibility patterns and patient allergies.

Prompt treatment with IV antibiotics is crucial to prevent complications and improve maternal outcomes. Monitoring clinical response to antibiotics, including fever resolution and improvement in uterine tenderness, is essential in subsequent management.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy 19-year-old individual is brought to the emergency department by a friend after briefly losing consciousness. They passed out while moving furniture into the friend's apartment. The friend said that the individual was unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness and was not confused. The patient did not have any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. They have had episodes of dizziness when exercising at the gym. Their blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The clinical scenario described suggests a case of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). HOCM is a condition that often presents in young, previously healthy individuals and can cause symptoms such as dizziness, syncope (fainting), and shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion.

Key findings in this case include:
1. **Syncope during exertion**: The patient passed out while moving furniture, which is a common presenting symptom in HOCM due to the obstruction of blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta during physical activity.
2. **Dizziness with exercise**: This is another common symptom due to the dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction or arrhythmias.
3. **Murmurs that change with maneuvers**: The systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and the systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation, are characteristic of HOCM. The murmur in HOCM is due to turbulent blood flow caused by the hypertrophied septum obstructing the left ventricular outflow tract. This murmur typically increases with maneuvers that reduce left ventricular volume (such as standing or the Valsalva maneuver) and decreases with maneuvers that increase left ventricular volume (such as passive leg elevation or squatting).

In summary, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"A 27-year-old individual presents for a checkup. They are 20 weeks pregnant and have been admitted to the hospital multiple times during the pregnancy for seizures. They have a known seizure disorder but discontinued their valproic acid when they became pregnant. The patient's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. They do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. They generally prefer not to take medications and typically see a shaman for care. Given the recent hospitalization, the patient agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time?","The most appropriate treatment for this patient, considering their history of a seizure disorder and recent seizures during pregnancy, would involve managing their seizure disorder safely and effectively during pregnancy. In the context of pregnancy, the choice of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) requires careful consideration due to potential teratogenic risks.

Given that the patient has agreed to start carbamazepine, here are key considerations and steps at this point:

1. **Initiate Carbamazepine**: If carbamazepine has been agreed upon, it should be started at the minimum effective dose. The patient needs to be closely monitored for seizure control and any potential side effects.

2. **Monitoring and Dosage Adjustment**: Regular monitoring of carbamazepine levels in the blood is crucial, as pregnancy can affect drug metabolism. Adjustments should be made based on clinical response and blood levels.

3. **Folic Acid Supplementation**: It's essential to prescribe folic acid supplementation (usually 4-5 mg daily) to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, which is higher with the use of antiepileptic drugs.

4. **Vitamin K Supplementation**: In the last month of pregnancy, vitamin K supplementation might be advisable to prevent neonatal hemorrhagic complications associated with the use of certain AEDs (like carbamazepine).

5. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Care should involve a multidisciplinary team including an obstetrician, neurologist, and possibly a pediatrician to ensure both maternal and fetal well-being throughout the pregnancy and delivery.

6. **Patient Education**: Educate the patient about the importance of medication adherence, potential side effects, and the signs of complications that should prompt immediate medical attention.

In summary, the most appropriate treatment is to initiate carbamazepine with careful monitoring of levels and adjusting the dose as necessary, alongside appropriate supplementation of folic acid and possibly vitamin K later in pregnancy. Additionally, comprehensive patient education and a multidisciplinary approach to care are critical.

4,"A 45-year-old individual presents to their primary care physician for an annual checkup. They state that they feel well and have no complaints. They live alone and work as a banker. They smoke 1 cigarette per day and drink 2 alcoholic beverages per night. They occasionally get symmetrical pain in their hands where they change from red to white to blue then return to normal again. Their temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and they return 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in their legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in their extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","Given the clinical presentation, the smoker's quantified smoking status, and the observed acute condition with weight gain and bilateral edema after hypertensive treatment, it suggests a more complex underlying issue requiring thorough evaluation. Among the choices for the best next step in management, the following should be considered:

1. **Medication Review:** Considering the recent treatment for hypertension, some antihypertensive medications, particularly calcium channel blockers like amlodipine, can cause peripheral edema. This makes a review of medications the immediate step to correlate the edema with any recent changes.

2. **Renal Function Evaluation:** Hypertension coupled with edema raises the suspicion of potential renal involvement. A measurement of serum creatinine and urinalysis would be necessary to rule out nephrotic syndrome or other renal pathologies.

3. **Cardiac Evaluation:** Even though there’s no immediate shortness of breath or overt signs of heart disease, hypertension places the patient at risk of heart failure, which can manifest as peripheral edema. An echocardiogram and possibly a BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) test can help in assessing cardiac function.

4. **Liver Function Tests:** Though less likely, hepatic pathologies can also present with edema and should be ruled out with appropriate liver function tests.

5. **Screening for other conditions:** Given the symmetry and color changes reported, Raynaud's phenomenon should also be considered, which could have systemic implications, potentially linked with autoimmune conditions that also impact the kidneys and heart.

The best next step, based on prioritizing immediate medication review and ruling out any adverse reactions as it pertains directly to recent interventions, would be:

**Review the antihypertensive medication regimen and evaluate for possible side effects that could be contributing to the symptoms.**

Subsequently, a thorough investigation incorporating renal, cardiac, and possibly hepatic function tests should follow if no resolution or if further symptoms persist.",Lisinopril,No
5,"A 42-year-old person comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. The patient was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The patient has systemic sclerosis complicated by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as indicated by the progressively worsening shortness of breath, enlarged pulmonary vessels, prominent right heart border, and elevated right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. The beneficial effect of this drug in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension is primarily due to its ability to increase the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the pulmonary vasculature. Here's how it works:

1. **Nitric Oxide (NO) Pathway Enhancement**: Tadalafil inhibits PDE-5, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cGMP.
2. **Increased cGMP Levels**: Inhibition of PDE-5 leads to increased levels of cGMP.
3. **Vasodilation**: Elevated cGMP levels lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vessels by promoting relaxation of the smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls.
4. **Decreased Pulmonary Artery Pressure**: The vasodilation results in a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure.
5. **Right Heart Relief**: By reducing the pressure that the right ventricle has to pump against, tadalafil helps to alleviate the strain on the right side of the heart, potentially improving symptoms and exercise capacity.

Thus, the expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in this patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension is due to its ability to **increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)** through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5). This leads to pulmonary vasodilation, reduced pulmonary artery pressure, and decreased right ventricular workload.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,No
6,"A 17-year-old is brought to their primary care provider by their parent. They are concerned that the teen's acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over the counter products without success. The teenager is otherwise healthy and without complaint. They were born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and are up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. The teenager is having trouble with school and has a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, the teenager stands 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members, with inflamed pustular acne on their face, shoulders, and chest. They are otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this patient’s clinical features?","Based on the clinical features presented, the teenager displays symptoms that are compatible with Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic condition that results from an extra X chromosome in males. The key features that guide this consideration include:

1. **Tall stature**: The teenager is significantly taller than average and taller than either parent or other family members, which is a common characteristic of Klinefelter syndrome.
2. **Developmental delays**: There is a noted delay in developmental milestones, particularly in language development.
3. **Behavioral issues**: The teenager is having trouble with school and has a history of misbehavior.
4. **Acne**: Severe acne is a common dermatological finding in teenagers but can also be more pronounced in individuals with certain genetic disorders.

Klinefelter syndrome typically presents with a 47,XXY karyotype. 

Therefore, the most likely karyotype associated with this patient's clinical features is:

**47,XXY**",47 XYY,No
7,"A 72-year-old person presents to their primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. They state that their trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. They are able to hear when someone is speaking to them; however, they have difficulty with understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to their current symptoms, they report a steady ringing in both ears and at times experience dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for a parent being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. Their temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally in both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","The symptoms presented by the patient, including progressively worsening hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech particularly in noisy environments, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and occasional dizziness, are consistent with sensorineural hearing loss. The physical examination findings with the tuning fork tests are critical in distinguishing the type of hearing loss:

1. **Weber Test**: This involves placing a vibrating tuning fork on the middle of the forehead. The patient reports hearing the sound equally in both ears, which suggests either normal hearing or symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss.

2. **Rinne Test**: This involves comparing air conduction (AC) to bone conduction (BC) of sound by placing the tuning fork near the external auditory canal and then on the mastoid process. The patient reports that air conduction is greater than bone conduction (AC > BC), which is consistent with normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss.

Given these findings and the patient's history, the most likely cause of the symptoms is **presbycusis**.

**Presbycusis** is age-related hearing loss that typically occurs gradually and affects both ears equally. It often begins in the high-frequency range, which affects the ability to understand speech, especially in noisy environments. The patient's age and the gradual worsening over 7-8 years fit this diagnosis well. The presence of tinnitus and occasional dizziness can also be associated with presbycusis, although these symptoms can sometimes indicate other underlying conditions.

The medical history of acute otitis media and family history of cholesteatoma are noted but less likely to explain the symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss indicated by the tuning fork tests.

### Other Possible Diagnoses:
- **Noise-Induced Hearing Loss**: This could also present with similar symptoms but generally has a history of substantial noise exposure.
- **Meniere's Disease**: Characterized by hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo, but typically presents with episodic vertigo rather than occasional dizziness.
- **Otosclerosis**: Typically causes conductive hearing loss rather than sensorineural hearing loss.

### Conclusion:
Given the symmetrical nature of the hearing loss, the gradual progression, and the age of the patient, **presbycusis** is the most likely diagnosis.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,No
8,"A 68-year-old individual presents to the office for their annual physical examination. They have no current complaints. Past medical history is unremarkable. They report a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is only remarkable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when they cough. A non-contrast CT scan of their chest is performed, and the doctor informs them that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in the upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised by this news since they have never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs them that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease. The doctor says that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms, which is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this patient?","The concept the doctor is describing to the patient is **lead-time bias**. 

Lead-time bias occurs when early detection of a disease (for instance, through screening) appears to prolong survival time, not because the disease course is actually altered, but simply because the disease was detected earlier than it would have been through symptomatic diagnosis. In the context of lung cancer, detecting a nodule through screening in someone with risk factors (like a significant smoking history) can mean identifying the disease before it becomes symptomatic. Consequently, the time from diagnosis to death can seem longer due to the earlier start point, without necessarily changing the actual progression or prognosis of the disease.",Latent period,No
9,"A 24-year-old individual comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. This person reports cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. They claim that this is their 5th episode within the past year and are concerned if “there’s something else going on.” Their medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with an albuterol inhaler. Laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39%
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The clinical presentation and laboratory findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). CVID is one of the most common primary immunodeficiency disorders, and it is characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and/or IgM), which leads to a predisposition to recurrent infections.

Key points supporting the diagnosis of CVID in this case include:

1. Clinical Presentation:
   - Recurrent sinus infections: The patient reports frequent episodes of sinusitis (5 episodes in the past year).
   - Prolonged symptoms of the current infection: Symptoms have lasted 13 days and include headache, sinus drainage, congestion, cough, and chills.

2. Laboratory Findings:
   - Low levels of immunoglobulins:
     - IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
     - IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
     - IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)
   - The leukocyte count is within the normal range, which is common in CVID as it primarily affects antibody production rather than white cell counts.

Given the patient’s history of recurrent infections and the significantly reduced levels of immunoglobulins, CVID is the most likely diagnosis. Further evaluation by an immunologist, including additional immunological testing and the assessment of vaccine responses, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide management. Treatment often involves immunoglobulin replacement therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of infections.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"A 33-year-old individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, they have had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. They feel like they cannot fully empty their bowels. They have no history of serious illness. They have a high-fiber diet. Their father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. They appear well. Their temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Their hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Here's the rationale:

1. **Intermittent abdominal cramps and diarrhea:** These symptoms are commonly seen in Crohn's disease.
2. **Weight loss:** A 5-kg weight loss over 4 months is significant and is often seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to malabsorption and decreased appetite.
3. **Incomplete evacuation of bowels:** This sensation is often reported by patients with Crohn's disease, particularly when there is inflammation or partial obstruction.
4. **Family history:** Being of Ashkenazi Jewish descent increases the risk for Crohn's disease as this population has a higher prevalence of IBD.
5. **Physical findings:** Mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant is common in Crohn's disease, which often affects the terminal ileum and right colon.
6. **Laboratory findings:** Anemia (hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL), elevated leukocyte count (12,000 mm3), elevated platelet count (480,000 mm3), and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 129 mm/h) are all indicative of an inflammatory process.
7. **Imaging findings:** A barium enema showing ulceration and narrowing of the right colon is a classic finding in Crohn's disease.

Given the clinical presentation, family history, and specific findings on examination and imaging, Crohn's disease is the most likely diagnosis.",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a 27-year-old individual is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm3 in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. The temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","In managing this patient's nutrition in the intensive care unit (ICU), it is important to consider the patient's overall condition and the preferred route of nutritional support. For critically ill patients, early enteral nutrition is generally preferred over parenteral nutrition, provided the gastrointestinal tract is functional.

Given the patient's stable vital signs and the fact that they have been stabilized post-surgery, the most appropriate next step in managing their nutrition would typically be to initiate **enteral nutrition** via a nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG) tube. 

**Rationale:**
1. **Early Enteral Nutrition (EEN):** EEN is well-documented to improve outcomes in critically ill patients as it supports gut integrity, reduces infection risk, and is more physiologic compared to parenteral nutrition.
2. **Functional GI Tract:** Assuming no contraindications (e.g., bowel obstruction, severe ileus), the gastrointestinal tract can likely be used for nutrition.
3. **NG or OG Tube:** The placement of an NG or OG tube allows for the gradual initiation and escalation of enteral feedings.

So, the most appropriate next step would be:
- **Initiate enteral feeding via an NG or OG tube.**

If the patient’s gastrointestinal tract were not functional, parenteral nutrition would be considered, but given the stability of other parameters and typical ICU protocols, starting with enteral feeding is both safe and beneficial where feasible.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"A 5-year-old child with developmental delays presents to the pediatrician’s office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of their knees, elbows, and around their eyelids. The patient's caregiver notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since the child was an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the child's skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in their sweat and urine. Based on the patient’s symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","Based on the presentation and historical details, the child likely has phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. The rashes and relapsing-remitting course of dermatitis, along with hypopigmentation and musty odor, are hallmark signs of PKU.

The most appropriate dietary recommendation for managing PKU is:

**Avoid high-phenylalanine foods** - This includes:
- Foods high in protein such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, nuts, and soy products.
- Avoid aspartame, which is a sweetener found in many diet sodas and sugar-free products, as it breaks down into phenylalanine.

Instead, the child should follow a phenylalanine-restricted diet rich in:
- Specially formulated low-protein foods.
- Fruits and vegetables (excluding high-protein legumes).
- Use of special medical foods and formulas designed for individuals with PKU that contain phenylalanine-free protein substitutes.

Regular dietary supervision by a metabolic dietitian is crucial to ensure nutritional needs are met while keeping phenylalanine levels safe. Continuous monitoring and dietary adjustments based on phenylalanine blood levels will be important throughout life.",Avoid meat,Yes
13,A 70-year-old individual presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. They have had hypertension for 20 years and are currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"Given the patient's history of longstanding hypertension and current elevated blood pressure (150/100 mm Hg), the most likely reason for the changes observed in the left ventricle on echocardiography is **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**. 

Chronic high blood pressure forces the heart to work harder to pump blood, which over time can cause the muscle wall of the left ventricle to thicken. This thickening can be detected via echocardiography. LVH is a common response to sustained hypertension and is considered an adaptive mechanism to maintain adequate cardiac output in the face of increased systemic vascular resistance.

In summary, the changes in the left ventricle most likely represent hypertrophy secondary to long-term, poorly controlled hypertension.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"A 25-year-old construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of their skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. They also complain of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. They are a smoker but recently have grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis?","The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are indicative of an acute hepatitis A infection, as evidenced by the positive Anti-HAV IgM.

Hepatitis A is most commonly transmitted via the fecal-oral route, which can occur through:

1. **Ingestion of contaminated water or food**: This might include raw or undercooked shellfish from contaminated waters.
2. **Direct person-to-person contact**: Especially in settings with poor sanitation, such as day-care centers, or among people who use recreational drugs.
3. **Travel to areas with high endemicity**: People who travel to regions where hepatitis A is more common are at higher risk.

Given the patient's profile (a construction worker with no significant past medical history, but having symptoms of hepatitis and a positive anti-HAV IgM antibody), the most likely mode of transmission would be through ingestion of food or water contaminated with the hepatitis A virus.

It is important to ensure appropriate public health measures are taken to prevent further transmission, including proper hygiene practices and, where indicated, vaccination.",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"A 5-year-old child is brought to the clinic for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is home schooled and a caregiver is concerned about the child's development. The child is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on their alphabet."" The patient always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind.” The child is observed to be focused on playing with cars during the interview. Physical examination demonstrates a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The patient's presentation is consistent with Fragile X syndrome, which is a genetic disorder often linked to developmental delays and certain physical characteristics. Key points from the provided information include:

1. **Developmental Delay**: The patient is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and is ""behind on their alphabet."" This delay in speech and language development is common in Fragile X syndrome.
2. **Behavioral Signs**: The child is described as being disinterested and focused on playing with cars, suggesting limited social interaction, which is also a characteristic of Fragile X syndrome.
3. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - **Poor Eye Contact**: Common in Fragile X syndrome due to social anxiety or autistic-like behaviors.
   - **Prominent Jaw**: A characteristic facial feature of Fragile X syndrome.
   - **Single Palmar Crease**: This is less specific but can be seen in various genetic disorders, including Fragile X syndrome.
   - **Bilaterally Enlarged Testicles (Macroorchidism)**: This is a hallmark of Fragile X syndrome, particularly noticeable in post-pubertal males.

The most likely mechanism underlying the findings in this patient is a genetic mutation involving the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. Specifically, Fragile X syndrome results from a trinucleotide repeat expansion (CGG) in the FMR1 gene, which leads to methylation and subsequent inactivation of the gene. This inactivation disrupts the production of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is necessary for normal neural development.

In summary, the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings is:
**Trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene leading to the production of dysfunctional or absent FMRP, causing Fragile X syndrome.**",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"A 65-year-old individual is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. This person has had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. They have gastritis as well as advanced Parkinson disease and currently live in an assisted-living community. They smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. They have a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but have not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. Their temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), they are tachycardic and tachypneic, and their oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show: 
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
A chest x-ray shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?","This patient presents with severe respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest pain, a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, and systemic signs of infection (fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea). The chest X-ray shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe, and there is evidence of a high leukocyte count and elevated lactic acid, which suggest a significant infection.

Given this history and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is aspiration pneumonia. The most significant predisposing factor here for the development of aspiration pneumonia is the patient's advanced Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease can lead to impaired swallowing mechanics, increased risk of aspiration, and decreased ability to clear oral secretions effectively. This risk is compounded by factors such as residing in an assisted-living facility, which can sometimes increase the risk of aspiration due to reduced mobility and other health care–related factors.

Additional contributory factors include:
- **History of smoking:** While smoking can contribute to chronic bronchitis or COPD, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the current acute infectious process.
- **History of alcohol abuse:** Alcohol abuse can lead to an increased risk of aspiration due to the possibility of impaired consciousness and esophageal motility issues.
- **Advanced age:** Older individuals generally have a higher risk of pneumonia due to a weakened immune system and decreased lung function.

However, the most significant and direct predisposing factor in this clinical scenario is the advanced Parkinson disease affecting the patient's ability to swallow properly, leading to aspiration and, subsequently, aspiration pneumonia.","Parkinson disease

17,A 37-year-old individual is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this patient?,"Based on the MRI findings indicating damage to a nerve located between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles, it is highly likely that the affected nerve is the **median nerve**. The median nerve runs between these muscle layers in the forearm.

Damage to the median nerve at this location would typically result in a loss of sensation in the areas of the hand it supplies. Specifically, you would expect to see:

- Loss of sensation in the **lateral palm** (the thumb side of the palm).
- Loss of sensation in the palmar aspect of the **thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger**.
- Loss of sensation on the **dorsal** aspect of the distal parts of the index finger, middle finger, and lateral half of the ring finger.

So, in summary, this patient is most likely to experience loss of sensation over the palmar surface of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger, as well as some areas on the dorsal side of these fingers.",Fingertip of the index finger,Yes
18,"A 46-year-old individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, they received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. Their blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; their vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this individual’s increase in creatinine concentration?","Given the clinical scenario—a kidney transplant recipient on immunosuppressive medications exhibiting progressive fatigue, loss of appetite, hypertension, normocytic normochromic anemia, and an increased serum creatinine concentration compared to 6 months ago—the underlying mechanism of the increased creatinine concentration is most likely chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), also known as chronic transplant nephropathy.

Chronic allograft nephropathy is a form of chronic rejection that typically occurs more than three months post-transplant and is characterized by progressive kidney dysfunction. Several factors can contribute to this condition including:

1. **Immune-mediated damage**: Chronic rejection can lead to fibrosis and scarring within the transplanted kidney.
2. **Drug toxicity**: Long-term use of immunosuppressants such as sirolimus and mycophenolate can have nephrotoxic effects, further exacerbating kidney function decline.
3. **Hypertension**: Poorly controlled blood pressure can contribute to worsening kidney function.
4. **Infection or other secondary factors**: Infections, such as from Cytomegalovirus (CMV), can lead to kidney damage post-transplant.

In summary, the most likely underlying mechanism of this individual’s increased creatinine concentration is chronic allograft nephropathy resulting from a combination of immune-mediated injury, potential nephrotoxic effects of immunosuppressive drugs, and possibly poorly controlled hypertension. Further evaluation with renal biopsy can help in confirming the diagnosis and guiding appropriate management.",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,No
19,"A 34-year-old individual with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, the individual is started on high dose folate supplementation, and follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. This individual is at risk for which long-term complication?","The individual described is at risk for **neurologic complications** due to vitamin B12 deficiency. 

Here’s a detailed explanation:

1. **Clinical Context**: The individual has undergone a gastric sleeve surgery, which can lead to malabsorption of various nutrients, including vitamin B12 and folate. The patient presents with macrocytic anemia, as evidenced by the elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 106 fL.

2. **Initial Work-Up and Response to Treatment**: Initial labs indicate a macrocytic anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit with high MCV), which can be associated with deficiencies in either folate or vitamin B12. Folate deficiency was suspected, and the patient was started on high dose folate supplementation.

3. **Follow-Up Results**: After folate supplementation, the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels have improved, and the MCV has decreased, suggesting that folate deficiency was at least part of the problem.

4. **Risk of Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: While folate supplementation can correct hematologic abnormalities, it does not address potential vitamin B12 deficiency. Importantly, if vitamin B12 deficiency is masked by folate supplementation, it can continue to progress and lead to significant neurological complications such as:
   - Peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness, and weakness in the extremities)
   - Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (leading to balance issues, difficulty walking, etc.)
   - Cognitive changes (memory impairment, personality changes, etc.)

5. **Potential Overlooked Deficiency**: Due to the prior gastric surgery leading to a higher risk of nutrient malabsorption and the persistence of an underlying condition that predisposes them to deficiencies (e.g., reduced intrinsic factor production), vitamin B12 deficiency should be considered and tested for comprehensively with serum vitamin B12 levels, and possibly methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels (both elevated in B12 deficiency).

**In Summary**: While high dose folate supplementation has helped correct the hematologic abnormalities, it is crucial to assess and manage vitamin B12 levels to prevent long-term neurologic complications. Thus, this patient is at risk for long-term neurologic complications if underlying vitamin B12 deficiency is not identified and treated.",Peripheral neuropathy,Yes
