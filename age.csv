0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, a 42-year-old person is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless, enlargement of their scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for an episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition?","The patient's symptoms and physical findings are most consistent with lymphatic filariasis, particularly caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, a parasitic infection. 

Lymphatic filariasis involves the filarial worms, which are transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. The adult worms reside in the lymphatic system, causing obstruction of lymphatic vessels. Over time, the obstruction of lymphatic drainage leading to chronic lymphedema can result, causing the progressive, painless enlargement of body parts commonly seen in the lower extremities and the scrotum. The fact that the scrotum transilluminates suggests fluid accumulation (likely lymph), supporting the diagnosis of lymphatic involvement.

To summarize, the underlying mechanism in this patient’s condition is obstruction of the lymphatic system. This is likely due to filarial worms causing a block in the lymphatic vessels, leading to an accumulation of lymph and subsequent enlargement of the scrotum.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,Yes
1,"A 27-year-old G1P1001 is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section. The surgery was indicated for breech presentation of the infant. The individual was at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation at the time of delivery. The patient is now complaining of purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding. They also note difficulty and discomfort with urination. The patient’s prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis, which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. The patient has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, the temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Examination reveals that the patient is uncomfortable and diaphoretic. The lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and the uterus is slightly boggy and soft. There is mild tenderness with uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this patient's condition?","The patient presents with postpartum fever, purulent lochia, a boggy uterus, continued heavy bleeding, and discomfort with urination three days after a Cesarean section. Given these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is postpartum endometritis, which is a common postpartum infection, especially after Cesarean delivery.

Clinical signs pointing towards this diagnosis include:
- Fever (101.2°F or 38.4°C)
- Tachycardia (pulse of 112/min)
- Purulent lochia
- A boggy and tender uterus

Postpartum endometritis is typically a polymicrobial infection that requires broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. The next best step in management is to initiate intravenous (IV) antibiotics immediately.

### Treatment Plan:
- **Antibiotics**: The recommended regimen typically includes a combination of **clindamycin** and **gentamicin**. This combination provides broad coverage against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria commonly involved in postpartum infections.

**Steps in management:**
1. **Start IV Antibiotics**:
   - **Clindamycin**: 900 mg every 8 hours IV.
   - **Gentamicin**: 5 mg/kg IV daily or 1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours IV (adjust dose based on renal function).
   
2. **Continued Monitoring**:
   - Monitor the patient’s vital signs, including temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.
   - Assess the patient’s pain and symptom relief.

3. **Evaluate for Other Complications**:
   - Given her urinary symptoms and history of pyelonephritis, consider urinalysis and urine culture to rule out concurrent urinary tract infection (UTI).

### Summary:
Start the patient on intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin immediately to treat suspected postpartum endometritis. Additionally, consider evaluating for other complications such as UTI to ensure comprehensive care.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy 19-year-old individual is brought to the emergency department by their partner after briefly losing consciousness. The individual passed out while moving furniture into the partner's apartment. The partner mentioned that the individual was unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness and was not confused. The patient did not have any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. They have had episodes of dizziness when exercising at the gym. Their blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, the most likely cause of the syncope in this 19-year-old individual is **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.

### Key Points Supporting Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy:

1. **Age and Health**: The individual is young and previously healthy, fitting the demographic that can often present with HCM symptoms.
   
2. **Syncope**: The individual experienced a brief loss of consciousness, which is a common symptom in HCM due to potential obstruction to blood flow or arrhythmias.

3. **Exercise-related Symptoms**: The history of dizziness during exercise aligns with symptoms of HCM, where physical exertion can exacerbate the obstruction due to increased heart rate and contractility.
   
4. **Blood Pressure and Pulse**: Both blood pressure and pulse readings are relatively normal, which suggests that the syncope was not due to primary abnormalities in blood pressure regulation.

5. **Murmur Characteristics**: A systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and apex, which disappears with maneuvers that increase venous return (like passive leg elevation), is characteristic of the dynamic obstruction seen in HCM. During these maneuvers, the increased volume in the heart reduces the degree of outflow tract obstruction, hence the disappearance of the murmur.

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Overview:
HCM is a genetic condition characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, particularly affecting the septum between the ventricles. This can cause outflow tract obstruction, mitral regurgitation, and arrhythmias, which can, in turn, lead to symptoms like syncope, palpitations, dizziness, and, in severe cases, sudden cardiac death.

### Management:
Upon suspecting HCM, the next steps usually include:
- **Echocardiography**: To confirm the diagnosis by visualizing the thickened myocardium and checking for any outflow tract obstruction.
- **Genetic Testing**: If appropriate, to identify the specific genetic mutation involved.
- **Monitoring and Treatment**: Depending on the findings, this may include medication (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers), lifestyle modifications (avoiding strenuous exercise), and possibly surgical interventions or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in cases with a high risk of arrhythmias.

Therefore, the clinical picture in this case strongly suggests **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** as the most likely diagnosis.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"A 27-year-old individual presents for a checkup. They are 20 weeks pregnant and have been admitted to the hospital multiple times during the pregnancy for seizures. They have a known seizure disorder but discontinued valproic acid when they became pregnant. The patient's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. They do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. They generally prefer not to take medications and see a shaman for their care typically. Given the recent hospitalization, the patient agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time?","In the context of a pregnant patient with a known seizure disorder who has discontinued valproic acid due to its teratogenic effects and has been experiencing seizures, careful management of their condition is crucial. The patient has now agreed to start carbamazepine, which is a reasonable choice given her current pregnancy status and need for seizure control.

The most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time includes:

1. **Starting Carbamazepine:** Initiating carbamazepine therapy to control seizures is appropriate. Carbamazepine is considered safer in pregnancy than some other antiepileptic drugs, particularly valproic acid, which is known to have higher teratogenic risks.

2. **Monitoring Serum Levels:** Regular monitoring of carbamazepine levels may be required to ensure therapeutic levels and avoid toxicity, especially given that pregnancy can alter the pharmacokinetics of medications.

3. **Folic Acid Supplementation:** High-dose folic acid supplementation (typically 4-5 mg daily) should be initiated. All women of childbearing age with epilepsy are recommended to take high-dose folic acid before conception and during the first trimester to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.

4. **Regular Prenatal Care:** The patient should continue with regular prenatal visits for routine pregnancy care and monitoring of fetal development.

5. **Consultation with a Neurologist:** Close coordination with a neurologist for specialized care in the management of epilepsy during pregnancy.

6. **Screening and Monitoring:** Detailed fetal anomaly ultrasound scans and possibly additional fetal monitoring should be utilized to monitor the development and detect any potential issues early.

By starting carbamazepine, monitoring the patient carefully, and ensuring appropriate supplementation and prenatal care, the risks associated with both the underlying seizure disorder and the use of antiepileptic medications during pregnancy can be mitigated.",Folate,No
4,"A 45-year-old individual presents to their primary care physician for an annual checkup. They state that they feel well and have no complaints. They live alone and work as a banker. They smoke 1 cigarette per day and drink 2 alcoholic beverages per night. They occasionally get symmetrical pain in their hands where they change from red to white to blue then return to normal again. Their temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and they return 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in their legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in their extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","Given the patient's history and symptoms, the best next step in management would be to conduct further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of the bilateral edema. The patient has a history of significant hypertension (blood pressure previously noted at 177/118 mmHg) and lifestyle factors such as smoking and regular alcohol consumption. The notable change of symmetric pain in the hands with color changes (white to blue to red) suggests a possible underlying vascular issue, like Raynaud's phenomenon, but does not directly explain the edema.

The presence of bilateral edema in the extremities might indicate systemic issues such as heart failure, renal failure, or liver disease, or could be related to other causes such as medication side effects or lymphatic obstruction. It is essential to rule out these possibilities systematically.

Here are appropriate steps in the next phase of management:

1. **Detailed Clinical Evaluation**:
   - Reassess medical history and any new symptoms.
   - Review current medications that might contribute to edema.
   
2. **Physical Examination**:
   - Perform a detailed cardiovascular and respiratory examination to look for signs of heart failure.
   - Abdominal examination to identify hepatomegaly or ascites, which may indicate liver disease.
   
3. **Laboratory Tests**:
   - Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) for renal and liver function.
   - Complete blood count (CBC) for overall health.
   - Thyroid function tests, as hypo/hyperthyroidism can also cause edema.
   
4. **Cardiac Evaluation**:
   - Electrocardiogram (ECG) to look for signs of ischemic heart disease or other cardiac abnormalities.
   - Chest X-Ray to evaluate heart size and pulmonary status.
   - Consider an echocardiogram if there is suspicion of heart failure.

5. **Additional Tests** based on initial findings:
   - Urinalysis to check for proteinuria or other renal pathology.
   - B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) if heart failure is suspected.
   - Doppler ultrasound of the legs if venous insufficiency or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are considerations.

Address lifestyle factors (smoking cessation and alcohol consumption) and closely monitor the patient’s blood pressure and manage hypertension aggressively to prevent further complications.

Therefore, to summarize, the next best step is to conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation to identify the cause of the bilateral edema and appropriately address the underlying condition.",Lisinopril,No
5,"A 42-year-old individual comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. This person was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The patient described is experiencing progressive shortness of breath and has a history of systemic sclerosis, which can lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The physical and imaging findings, along with the elevated right ventricular pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure, further support the diagnosis of PAH.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. The expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in treating PAH is primarily due to:

**Increased intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).**

Here’s how it works:

1. **Mechanism of Action**: Tadalafil, by inhibiting PDE-5, prevents the breakdown of cGMP.
2. **cGMP Function**: cGMP is crucial in the relaxation of smooth muscle cells. Elevated levels of cGMP lead to vasodilation.
3. **Pulmonary Vasculature**: In the lungs, cGMP-mediated vasodilation helps reduce pulmonary vascular resistance, thereby lowering pulmonary artery pressure.
4. **Outcome**: The overall reduction in pulmonary artery pressure translates to decreased workload on the right ventricle, improving symptoms such as shortness of breath and potentially improving exercise capacity.

Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in treating this patient's condition is primarily through increasing intracellular concentrations of cGMP, promoting vasodilation, and ultimately reducing pulmonary artery hypertension.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,No
6,"A 17-year-old is brought to their primary care provider by their parent. They are concerned that their acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over-the-counter products without success. They are otherwise healthy and without complaint. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. They are up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. They are having trouble with school and have a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, they stand 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members with inflamed pustular acne on their face, shoulders, and chest. They are otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this patient’s clinical features?","The clinical features of the patient, including tall stature, developmental delays (especially in language development), and behavioral issues, suggest a possible underlying genetic condition. The most likely karyotype associated with these features is **47,XXY**, which corresponds to Klinefelter syndrome. 

Klinefelter syndrome is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males, leading to a 47,XXY karyotype. Individuals with Klinefelter syndrome often present with:

- **Tall stature**: Males with Klinefelter syndrome are typically taller than average.
- **Delayed development**: They may experience delays in speech and language development.
- **Learning difficulties**: Difficulties in school can be common, as can behavioral issues.
- **Acne**: Severe acne can occur in puberty and adolescence, as seen in your patient.
- **Other potential features**: Underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics and small testes, but these features may be more difficult to evaluate in a primary care setting without a thorough clinical examination focusing on this aspect.

Therefore, the most likely karyotype associated with this patient's clinical features is **47,XXY**.",47 XYY,No
7,"A 72-year-old individual presents to their primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. They state that their trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. They are able to hear when someone is speaking to them; however, they have difficulty understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to their current symptoms, they report a steady ringing in both ears and, at times, experience dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for a parent being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. Their temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally in both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","The symptoms presented by this 72-year-old individual, which include progressively worsening hearing loss over several years, difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy environments, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and occasional dizziness, are suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss. The tuning fork tests — which show sound being appreciated equally in both ears when placed in the middle of the forehead (Weber test) and air conduction being greater than bone conduction (Rinne test) — further support this diagnosis, as these results are consistent with sensorineural rather than conductive hearing loss.

Given the patient's age, duration of symptoms, and the pattern of hearing loss described, the most likely cause of the symptoms is **presbycusis** (age-related hearing loss). 

### Key Points Supporting Presbycusis:
1. **Age and Gradual Onset**: The patient is 72 years old and has had progressively worsening hearing loss beginning about 7-8 years ago, which fits the typical age of onset and gradual progression of presbycusis.
2. **Difficulty Understanding Speech**: Especially in noisy environments is a hallmark of presbycusis due to the loss of high-frequency hearing, which affects the clarity of speech.
3. **Bilateral Symptoms**: The presence of bilateral symptoms (hearing loss in both ears, bilateral tinnitus) is common in presbycusis.
4. **Tuning Fork Test Results**: Weber test showing no lateralization and Rinne test showing air conduction greater than bone conduction are both indicative of sensorineural hearing loss.

### Differential Diagnosis Considerations:
- **Cholesteatoma**: Given the family history, cholesteatoma could be considered, but this typically causes conductive hearing loss rather than sensorineural.
- **Menieres Disease**: Can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness but often presents with episodic vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss, not the gradual, steady pattern seen here.
- **Ototoxic Medications**: The history provided does not indicate the use of ototoxic medications.
- **Noise-Induced Hearing Loss**: Usually presents earlier in life and is associated with a history of exposure to loud noise.
- **Acoustic Neuroma**: This typically causes unilateral hearing loss and additional neurological symptoms.

### Conclusion:
The patient's presentation is most consistent with **presbycusis**, a common cause of sensorineural hearing loss in the elderly. This condition results from age-related changes in the inner ear structures and auditory pathways, leading to the symptoms described. An audiogram would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and assess the degree and pattern of hearing loss.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,No
8,"A 68-year-old patient presents to the office for their annual physical examination. They have no current complaints. Past medical history is unremarkable. The patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is only remarkable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when they cough. A non-contrast CT scan of their chest is performed, and the doctor informs the patient that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in the upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised by this news since they have never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs the patient that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease. The doctor says that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms, which is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this patient?","The concept being described by the doctor to the patient is the **""lead time bias.""** 

Lead time bias occurs when early detection of a disease (through screening) increases the time a person knows about their disease without actually prolonging overall survival. This can give a misleading impression of improved survival time but doesn't necessarily mean the outcome is better. In this patient's case, they had no symptoms, yet a nodule was found through a screening CT scan. The doctor is explaining that early detection can lead to identifying conditions like lung cancer before they become symptomatic and severe. This early detection can make it seem like the patient is living longer with the disease simply because it was detected sooner, not necessarily because their prognosis has improved.",Latent period,No
9,"A 24-year-old individual comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. The patient reports cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse and endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. They claim that this is their 5th episode within the past year and express concern if “there’s something else going on.” The patient's medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with an albuterol inhaler. Their laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39 %
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The most likely diagnosis for this 24-year-old individual presenting with frequent episodes of sinusitis and abnormal immunoglobulin levels is **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**. 

CVID is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and/or IgM) and impaired antibody responses to infections. The presenting symptoms like recurrent sinus infections, along with the specific laboratory findings showing decreased levels of IgA (54 mg/dL), IgG (470 mg/dL), and IgM (29 mg/dL), strongly suggest CVID. The leukocyte count is normal, which is common in CVID, as the primary issue is with the antibody production rather than the number of leukocytes.

Given that the patient has had multiple episodes of sinusitis in a short period and has abnormal immunoglobulin levels, it is crucial to evaluate for CVID. Further immune workup, management through immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and possibly avoiding exposure to potential respiratory pathogens might be necessary. It is also important to monitor for other complications associated with CVID such as autoimmune disorders, granulomas, and increased risk of infections.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"A 33-year-old individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, they have experienced a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. They feel like they cannot fully empty their bowels. They have no history of serious illness and maintain a high-fiber diet. Their father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The patient appears well. Their temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. A test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Their hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's symptoms and diagnostic findings point towards a specific type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Given the combination of chronic symptoms including lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, a significant weight loss, and right lower quadrant tenderness, along with the negative stool occult blood test, elevated leukocyte count, thrombocytosis, and a greatly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Crohn's disease is the most likely diagnosis.

Below is the reasoning based on the presented data:

- The chronic nature of the symptoms (4 months) with associated weight loss suggests a chronic inflammatory condition.
- The patient's elevated leukocyte count (12,000/mm³) and elevated platelet count (480,000/mm³) are common inflammatory markers.
- The significant elevation in ESR (129 mm/h) indicates inflammation.
- The barium enema findings showing ulceration and narrowing of the right colon are characteristic of Crohn's disease, which commonly affects the ileum and right colon.
- The patient's clinical presentation fits the typical course of Crohn's disease. This includes the involvement of any part of the gastrointestinal tract but is most commonly the terminal ileum and proximal colon, presenting with symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and sometimes extraintestinal manifestations.
- The family history and ethnicity may suggest a genetic predisposition, as Crohn's disease has been found to have a higher prevalence in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

Given the comprehensive analysis of the symptoms, examination findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies, Crohn's disease is highly consistent with this clinical picture.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is:
**Crohn's disease.**",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a 27-year-old individual is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm3 in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. The temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","Given the clinical scenario described, the patient is critically ill and requires proper nutritional support to enhance recovery. Nutrition is a critical component of the care of patients in an intensive care unit (ICU), especially those recovering from major surgeries or traumatic injuries. 

In critically ill patients, enteral nutrition (EN) is generally preferred over parenteral nutrition (PN) when the gastrointestinal tract is functional because it helps maintain gut integrity, reduces the risk of infections, and is more physiologically appropriate.

**The most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition is to initiate enteral nutrition.**

**Here are some key points and steps for initiating enteral nutrition:**

1. **Assessment of Gastrointestinal Function:** Ensure that the patient’s gastrointestinal tract is functional and there are no contraindications to enteral feeding such as bowel obstruction, severe ileus, or significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

2. **Early Enteral Feeding:** If the gastrointestinal tract is functional, early enteral feeding (within 24-48 hours of ICU admission) should be initiated as it has been shown to improve outcomes in critically ill patients.

3. **Select the Enteral Feeding Route:** For patients on mechanical ventilation, a nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG) tube is commonly used to deliver the enteral nutrition. For long-term feeding, alternatives like percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) might be considered later if necessary.

4. **Start with a Trophic Feed:** Initiate with a trophic (low volume) feed and gradually increase to the target feeding rate as tolerated, closely monitoring for signs of feeding intolerance such as high gastric residual volumes, abdominal distension, or vomiting.

5. **Calculate Nutrient Needs:** Determine the patient’s caloric and protein requirements based on their current clinical status, taking into account factors such as the stress of illness and energy expenditure.

6. **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor the patient for any complications or intolerance to the feed and adjust the feeding regimen as needed. This can include monitoring metabolic parameters, fluid status, electrolyte balance, and nutritional markers.

**Example Implementation:**

- Start enteral feeding with a standard polymeric formula, delivering nutrition via an NG or OG tube.
- Begin with a trophic rate, such as 10-20 mL/hour, and advance as tolerated every 4-6 hours.
- Monitor gastric residuals and other signs of feeding intolerance regularly.
- Adjust the feeding protocol according to patient’s tolerance, energy, and protein needs, and metabolic responses.

In summary, early initiation of enteral nutrition is crucial in this critically ill patient to support recovery and optimize clinical outcomes.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"A 5-year-old child with developmental delays presents to their pediatrician’s office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of their knees, elbows, and around their eyelids. The patient's caregiver notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since the child was an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the patient's skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in their sweat and urine. Based on the patient's symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","The most appropriate dietary recommendation for this child, given the constellation of symptoms including developmental delays, itchy rash on the flexor surfaces, hypopigmentation, and a musty odor in the sweat and urine, would be dietary restriction of phenylalanine. These signs strongly suggest a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU).

PKU is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which results in the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body. If left untreated, the buildup of phenylalanine can lead to severe intellectual disability and other neurological issues.

To manage PKU, individuals must follow a strict diet that limits phenylalanine, which is found in high-protein foods such as meat, dairy products, and nuts. Special protein supplements and medical foods that do not contain phenylalanine are usually necessary to ensure adequate nutrition while avoiding phenylalanine.

So, the dietary recommendation for this patient would be:

**Dietary restriction of phenylalanine.**",Avoid meat,Yes
13,A 70-year-old patient presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. They have had hypertension for 20 years and are currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. Their blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"The most likely reason for the changes in the left ventricle observed on echocardiography in this 70-year-old patient with a long history of hypertension is **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**.

Hypertension, especially when poorly controlled over a long period, puts increased pressure on the heart, specifically the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. To manage this increased workload, the muscle wall of the left ventricle thickens, a condition known as left ventricular hypertrophy. This hypertrophic adaptation initially helps the heart to cope with elevated blood pressure, but over time it can lead to decreased cardiac efficiency and potential complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease.

Given the patient's elevated blood pressure (150/100 mm Hg) despite being on multiple anti-hypertensive medications, it is evident that their hypertension is resistant or difficult to control, further contributing to the development of LVH.

It's essential for the managing healthcare provider to carefully review and possibly adjust the patient's hypertension management strategy to improve blood pressure control and minimize further cardiac complications.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"A 25-year-old construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. There is also a complaint of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. The individual is a smoker but recently has grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis?","The patient's clinical presentation and hepatitis viral panel results indicate an acute hepatitis A (HAV) infection (evidenced by a positive Anti-HAV IgM). HAV infection commonly presents with jaundice, nausea, loss of appetite, and other flu-like symptoms. Hepatitis A is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated food and water.

Considering the patient's occupation as a construction worker, it is plausible that the individual might have consumed contaminated food or water at the workplace or elsewhere.

Therefore, the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis (acute hepatitis A) is through the fecal-oral route.",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"A 5-year-old child is brought to the clinic by a parent for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is home schooled and the parent is concerned about the child’s development. The child is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on the alphabet.” The child always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind.” The patient is observed to be focused on playing with cars during the interview. Physical examination demonstrates a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The clinical presentation described in the question suggests that the child may have Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS is a genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability, developmental delays, and characteristic physical features. Let's break down the key elements of the case that support this diagnosis:

1. **Developmental Delay**: The child has been reported to be ""behind"" on developmental milestones, such as speech (limited to 2-3 word sentences) and interest in typical activities.

2. **Behavioral Symptoms**: The child appears disinterested and shows poor eye contact, which can be indicative of social and communication challenges often observed in FXS.

3. **Physical Features**:
   - Prominent jaw (mandibular prognathism).
   - Single palmar crease (although this is less specific, it can be associated with various genetic conditions).
   - Enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) which is a hallmark of FXS especially apparent after the age of puberty, but can be noticed in some prepubertal cases.

Given these observations, the most likely mechanism underlying this patient’s findings involves a **genetic mutation on the FMR1 gene** on the X chromosome. This mutation is characterized by an expansion of the CGG triplet repeat beyond the normal range.

**Mechanism of Disease**:
- **Fragile X Syndrome**: The FMR1 gene usually has less than 45 CGG repeats. In individuals with FXS, the CGG repeat is expanded to over 200 repeats (a full mutation), leading to methylation and silencing of the FMR1 gene. The lack of the protein product of this gene (FMRP) is what causes the clinical manifestations observed in FXS.

In summary, the most likely mechanism of this patient's findings is an **expansion of the CGG triplet repeat in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome**, leading to reduced or absent production of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), resulting in the developmental, cognitive, and physical findings observed.",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"A 65-year-old person is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. They have had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. They have gastritis as well as advanced Parkinson's disease and currently live in an assisted-living community. They smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. They have a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but have not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. Their temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), they are tachycardic and tachypneic, and their oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm³
Platelet count 210,000/mm³
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
An x-ray of the chest shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?","This patient's respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest pain, productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, along with right upper lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray and signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, elevated leukocyte count, and elevated lactic acid), are highly suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when oropharyngeal or gastric contents are inhaled into the lungs, leading to an infectious process.

Given that this patient has advanced Parkinson's disease, this condition is likely the most significant predisposing factor for their respiratory symptoms. Advanced Parkinson's disease often leads to dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) due to impaired coordination of the muscles involved in swallowing and diminished cough reflex. This increases the risk of aspiration of food, liquids, or gastric contents into the lungs, especially in an elderly population, leading to aspiration pneumonia.

Other potential contributing factors include:
- Living in an assisted-living community, where there is a higher likelihood of exposure to respiratory pathogens.
- A long history of smoking, which could have compromised the patient’s pulmonary defenses.
- Previous alcohol abuse, which can impair immune and pulmonary function.

However, the primary factor linking all these findings—particularly the context of advanced Parkinson's disease with dysphagia and an increased risk for aspiration events—is the most critical predisposing factor that led to the patient's aspiration pneumonia.","Parkinson disease

17,A 37-year-old individual is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this patient?,"Based on the information provided, the nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles in the forearm is the median nerve. The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger, as well as the dorsum of these fingers' distal phalanges.

Given this, the areas most likely to exhibit loss of sensation in this patient would be:

- The palmar surface of the thumb
- The palmar surface of the index finger
- The palmar surface of the middle finger
- The palmar surface of the lateral half of the ring finger
- The tips of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and lateral half of the ring finger on the dorsal side

Therefore, the patient is most likely to experience loss of sensation over these regions if the median nerve is damaged.",Fingertip of the index finger,No
18,"A 46-year-old individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, they received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. Blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; their vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration?","The patient's increase in serum creatinine concentration and associated clinical findings are suggestive of potential chronic allograft nephropathy, likely due to chronic rejection. Given their kidney transplant history and current immunosuppressive regimen, this is a serious consideration. Here, elevated blood pressure, anemia, and significantly worsened renal function over the past six months point towards this possibility.

To summarize:
- **Medication History**: The patient is on sirolimus and mycophenolate, both immunosuppressants, which are standard post-transplant medications to prevent rejection. However, chronic rejection can still occur over time.
- **Blood Pressure**: Elevated blood pressure (150/95 mm Hg) could be both a cause and a consequence of worsening kidney function.
- **Laboratory Findings**: Normocytic, normochromic anemia and elevated serum creatinine (3.1 mg/dL) are indicative of chronic kidney disease or worsening renal function.
- **Recent Changes**: The creatinine and blood pressure were normal six months ago, indicating a recent and progressive deterioration.
  
The most likely underlying mechanism is chronic rejection leading to chronic allograft nephropathy. Chronic rejection involves both immune-mediated damage and non-immunologic factors that cause progressive scarring and dysfunction in the transplanted kidney. It often presents with declining kidney function, hypertension, and proteinuria if tested further.

Other potential but less likely mechanisms, given the patient's history and presentation, could include medication toxicity (though sirolimus and mycophenolate typically do not cause such rapid and severe renal function decline without other contributing factors) or recurrent original kidney disease.

Therefore, the primary underlying mechanism here is:
- **Chronic allograft nephropathy due to chronic rejection**",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,No
19,"A 34-year-old individual with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, the individual is started on high-dose folate supplementation, and follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. This person is at risk for which long-term complication?","The patient described has improved their hematologic profile with folate supplementation, as indicated by the increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and a decrease in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). However, given their history of a gastric sleeve operation, they remain at risk for several long-term complications, particularly related to nutrient malabsorption.

One significant long-term complication they are at risk for is **vitamin B12 deficiency**. Gastric sleeve surgery can lead to alterations in the digestive tract that impair the absorption of various nutrients. Specifically:

- **Intrinsic Factor Reduction:** Gastric sleeve surgery can reduce the production of intrinsic factor, a protein produced in the stomach that is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the ileum.
- **Reduced Stomach Acid:** The surgery reduces the size of the stomach, which can decrease acid production. Adequate stomach acid is necessary to separate vitamin B12 from the protein in food, a preliminary step before it can bind intrinsic factor.

Vitamin B12 deficiency, if not identified and treated, can lead to several long-term complications including:

1. **Neurological Complications:** Sustained vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to peripheral neuropathy, which manifests as numbness, tingling, and even motor disturbances. Severe deficiency can result in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.
2. **Megaloblastic Anemia:** Although the patient had macrocytosis initially indicated by the elevated MCV, folate supplementation alone might mask but not fully correct the hematologic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency.
3. **Cognitive Impairments:** B12 deficiency is also associated with cognitive disturbances such as memory loss, confusion, and in severe cases, dementia.

Thus, even though the patient's immediate hematologic profile has improved with folate, they should be monitored and possibly supplemented with vitamin B12 to prevent these potential long-term complications. Regular follow-up and laboratory testing for vitamin B12 levels are warranted in patients with a history of bariatric surgery to ensure that deficiencies are promptly addressed.",Peripheral neuropathy,No
