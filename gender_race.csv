0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, a Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander man is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless enlargement of his scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for an episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this patient's condition?","The patient's condition is one of chronic painless enlargement of the scrotum that transilluminates, suggestive of a hydrocele. The underlying mechanism of a hydrocele is typically the accumulation of fluid within the tunica vaginalis, the outermost covering of the testicles. Here, given the prolonged history and gradual nature of the enlargement, the most likely cause considering the regional epidemiology and the patient's history is lymphatic filariasis, specifically infection with the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti, which is endemic in Southeast Asia.

Lymphatic filariasis is a common cause of hydrocele in endemic regions and is transmitted by mosquito bites. The parasite affects the lymphatic system, leading to lymphatic obstruction and subsequent fluid accumulation. The patient's smoking history and episodic fever align with possible recurrent parasitic infections, as filariasis can cause lymphangitis leading to fever episodes. 

Given this information, the most probable underlying mechanism for this patient's condition is:
- **Obstruction of lymphatic flow (lymphatic filariasis)**

Therefore, thorough evaluation for filarial infection including blood tests for microfilariae and specific antigen tests would be appropriate. Treatment would typically involve antiparasitic medications to address the underlying filarial infection, alongside supportive management for the hydrocele if necessary.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,No
1,"A Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander G1P1001 is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section. Her surgery was indicated for breech presentation of the infant. She was at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation at the time of delivery. The patient is now complaining of purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding. She also notes difficulty and discomfort with urination. The patient’s prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis, which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. The patient has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, her temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Exam reveals that she is uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Her lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and her uterus is slightly boggy and soft. There is mild tenderness with uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this patient's condition?","The patient appears to have a postpartum complication possibly indicative of a uterine infection, such as endometritis, given her symptoms and clinical findings. The presenting symptoms and physical examination findings that support this suspicion include:

- **Fever (101.2°F or 38.4°C)**
- **Tachycardia (heart rate of 112/min)**
- **Purulent lochia**
- **Boggy and tender uterus**
- **Continued heavy bleeding**

The next step in managing this patient should be the initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to treat the likely uterine infection. A common regimen includes intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin, which cover a broad range of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. 

Thus, the best next step in management is:
### Initiate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics.

Additionally, close monitoring of her vital signs, uterine involution, and bleeding is necessary. Adjustments to antibiotic therapy should be made based on culture results, if available, and clinical response.

Considering her symptoms of difficulty and discomfort with urination, a urinalysis and urine culture should also be performed to rule out a urinary tract infection, which could be contributing to her febrile state given her history of pyelonephritis.

Proper postpartum care, including supportive measures such as adequate hydration and pain control, should also be continued as part of her overall management plan.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy man, who is American Indian/Alaska Native, is brought to the emergency department by his girlfriend after briefly losing consciousness. He passed out while moving furniture into her apartment. She said that he was unresponsive for a minute but regained consciousness and was not confused. The patient did not have any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. He has had episodes of dizziness when exercising at the gym. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. On examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The patient's presentation, including brief loss of consciousness, a history of dizziness during exercise, and the presence of systolic murmurs that disappear with passive leg elevation, suggests a structural cardiac abnormality. The characteristics of the murmur described—located at the left lower sternal border and apex, and the fact that it disappears with maneuvers that increase venous return such as passive leg elevation—are highly suggestive of **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)**.

HOCM is a condition where there is abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the interventricular septum, leading to outflow obstruction. This obstruction can worsen with decreases in preload or afterload, which can lead to syncope or dizziness, especially during exertion.

Key points supporting HOCM in this case:
1. **Syncope During Physical Activity:** The patient experienced syncope during physical exertion.
2. **Absence of Chest Pain or Respiratory Symptoms:** There were no other symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.
3. **Murmur Characteristics:** The murmurs are systolic, medium-pitched, and heard at the left lower sternal border and apex. Additionally, the murmur decreases with leg elevation (an increase in preload).
4. **Vital Signs:** There isn’t a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing, which somewhat excludes conditions like orthostatic hypotension.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)**. This condition often requires further evaluation with echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of outflow obstruction. 

Management typically includes lifestyle modifications, medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, and in some cases, surgical interventions or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"A Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander woman presents for a checkup. She is 20 weeks pregnant and has been admitted to the hospital multiple times during her pregnancy for seizures. She has a known seizure disorder but discontinued her valproic acid when she became pregnant. The patient's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. She generally prefers not to take medications and sees a shaman for her care typically. Given her recent hospitalization, the patient agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time?","Given the patient's background of multiple seizures during pregnancy, the following points are crucial for the management of her condition:

1. **Seizure Control in Pregnancy:** Uncontrolled seizures pose significant risks to both the mother and the fetus, including hypoxia, trauma, and preterm labor. Effective seizure management is crucial.

2. **Medication Use in Pregnancy:** While valproic acid is often avoided in pregnancy due to its teratogenic effects, alternative antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) like carbamazepine can be used, although they also have some risks. The choice of AED should balance the risks to the fetus with the necessity of seizure control for maternal and fetal well-being.

3. **Carbamazepine:** Carbamazepine is an appropriate choice as it is generally considered safer than valproic acid for use during pregnancy, although it also carries some risk of congenital malformations. Monitoring and dosage adjustment are important.

4. **Folic Acid Supplementation:** Since carbamazepine (like other AEDs) can interfere with folate metabolism and increase the risk of neural tube defects, it is vital to supplement with folic acid, especially in the first trimester. However, given that she is already at 20 weeks' gestation, folic acid supplementation should still be continued.

5. **Interdisciplinary Care:** The patient prefers traditional shamanic care and generally avoids medications, so her treatment plan should ideally integrate her cultural beliefs. Collaboration with her shaman and providing education about the necessity of seizure control during pregnancy will be crucial for adherence.

Considering these points, the most appropriate treatment plan should include:

- **Starting carbamazepine** with close monitoring and dose adjustment as necessary.
- **Folic acid supplementation** (although not as critical beyond the first trimester, continuing folic acid can support overall health).
- **Regular monitoring** of maternal and fetal well-being, including more frequent checkups and possibly more detailed ultrasounds to monitor fetal development.
- **Collaboration with her shaman** and continued support and education regarding the importance of seizure management during pregnancy.

Therefore, the appropriate treatment for this patient at this time is to:

- Administer carbamazepine for seizure control.
- Continue to provide education and reassurance about the safety measures in place for her and her baby.
- Maintain regular prenatal care and close monitoring of the maternal and fetal condition.
- Supplement with folic acid if not already doing so.",Folate,Yes
4,"A White woman presents to her primary care physician for an annual checkup. She states that she feels well and has no complaints. She lives alone and works as a banker. She smokes 1 cigarette per day and drinks 2 alcoholic beverages per night. She occasionally gets symmetrical pain in her hands where they change from red to white to blue then return to normal again. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and she returns 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in her legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in her extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","The patient's presentation of bilateral edema in the extremities, together with her history of hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, and particularly the distinctive symptom of her hands changing colors (red to white to blue) suggest a potential underlying systemic issue. The color changes in her hands are characteristic of Raynaud's phenomenon, which may be primary or secondary to another condition such as an autoimmune or connective tissue disease.

Given this scenario, one critical concern is to evaluate for possible underlying causes such as heart failure, renal issues, or an autoimmune disease. However, with the combination of her recent onset of bilateral edema, severe hypertension, and Raynaud's phenomenon, systemic conditions such as scleroderma or another connective tissue disease might be suspected.

In order to appropriately manage the patient's condition, a comprehensive workup is needed. The best next step in management is to perform:
 
**Laboratory testing for autoimmune diseases and a comprehensive metabolic panel.**

This testing should include:
1. **Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test** - a positive result could indicate an autoimmune process.
2. **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)** - these are markers of inflammation that can be elevated in autoimmune diseases.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)** - to check for anemia or other hematologic abnormalities.
4. **Renal function tests** - including serum creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) to assess for any renal impairment.
5. **Urinalysis** - to detect proteinuria or other abnormalities indicative of renal involvement.
6. **Electrolyte panel and liver function tests** - to rule out other systemic involvement.

Further workup could involve specific tests for scleroderma (e.g., anti-Scl-70 antibodies), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (e.g., anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith antibodies) if initial tests are suggestive.

It may also be prudent to refer her to a rheumatologist for further evaluation and management of possible connective tissue disease. Additionally, continued close monitoring and management of her hypertension, smoking cessation support, and addressing alcohol use are important aspects of her overall care.

Overall, identifying the underlying cause of her symptoms is crucial for targeted treatment and management.",Lisinopril,No
5,"A White man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. He was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The patient's presentation, including a history of systemic sclerosis, progressive shortness of breath, and findings on physical examination and cardiac catheterization, is strongly suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Systemic sclerosis is known to be associated with PAH, which can cause enlargement of the pulmonary arteries and right heart due to increased resistance in the pulmonary vasculature.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is used in the treatment of PAH. The beneficial effect of tadalafil in PAH is most likely due to its action of increasing the availability of nitric oxide (NO) by preventing the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Here's the mechanism:

1. Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by endothelial cells and diffuses into the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels.
2. NO activates guanylate cyclase, which in turn increases the production of cGMP.
3. cGMP leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle cells in blood vessels, causing vasodilation and therefore decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure.
4. PDE-5 enzymes degrade cGMP. By inhibiting PDE-5, tadalafil increases the level of cGMP, thereby enhancing and prolonging the vasodilatory effect of NO.

Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in this patient is due to:
**Increasing the intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)**.

This action helps in reducing the pulmonary arterial pressure and improves the symptoms associated with PAH by promoting vasodilation of the pulmonary vasculature.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,No
6,"A Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander is brought to his primary care provider by his mother. They are concerned that his acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over-the-counter products without success. He is otherwise healthy and without complaint. The person was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. He is having trouble with school and has a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, he stands 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members with inflamed pustular acne on his face, shoulders, and chest. He is otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this patient’s clinical features?","Based on the clinical presentation, the most likely karyotype associated with this patient's features is 47,XXY, which is indicative of Klinefelter syndrome. 

Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition where a male is born with an extra X chromosome. This can result in a variety of clinical features, some of which match the patient's presentation:

- Taller than average height (standing 6 ft 3 inches tall)
- Difficulties with language development or learning disabilities, which may lead to troubles in school and behavioral issues
- The presence of acne, which can be more severe in some cases

Klinefelter syndrome often goes undiagnosed until puberty or adulthood because many of its symptoms can be mild. The syndrome can also include other features such as small testes, reduced muscle mass, and reduced facial and body hair, but these are not mentioned in the case provided. However, the combination of his height, developmental delays, and behavioral issues strongly point towards Klinefelter syndrome being the likely diagnosis.

Thus, the karyotype 47,XXY is most likely associated with this patient’s clinical features.",47 XYY,No
7,"An American Indian/Alaska Native man presents to his primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. He states that his trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. He is able to hear when someone is speaking to him; however, he has difficulty with understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to his current symptoms, he reports a steady ringing in both ears and at times experiences dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for his father being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, sound is appreciated equally in both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","The patient's presentation of progressive hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech (especially in the presence of background noise), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and episodes of dizziness indicates that he might have sensorineural hearing loss. The significant medical history of prior acute otitis media and family history of cholesteatoma are notable but do not directly point to the most likely cause based on the physical findings.

The key physical exam findings include:

1. **Weber test**: When a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, the sound is appreciated equally in both ears. This suggests either normal hearing or bilateral symmetric hearing loss.

2. **Rinne test**: Air conduction being greater than bone conduction indicates either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss if there is indeed a hearing loss. In the case of conductive hearing loss, bone conduction would be greater than air conduction.

Given that both the Weber and Rinne tests point towards either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss, and considering the patient's symptoms of progressive hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness, the most likely diagnosis is **presbycusis**.

**Presbycusis** is age-related hearing loss that typically begins in the higher frequencies and progresses to include lower frequencies. It is the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss in adults and presents with difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy environments, which matches this patient's description. The experience of tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and dizziness can also align with presbycusis, as these symptoms are sometimes associated with sensorineural hearing loss conditions.

Therefore, the cause of this patient's symptoms is most likely **presbycusis**.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,No
8,"A man, who identifies as American Indian/Alaska Native, presents to the office for his annual physical examination with no current complaints. His past medical history is unremarkable, but he reports a 30-pack-year smoking history with no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is notable only for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when he coughs. A non-contrast CT scan of his chest reveals a 2 cm nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus, prompting the doctor to recommend further testing to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised, as he has never experienced alarming symptoms. The doctor explains that lung cancers often don’t present with symptoms until late in the disease course and that it may take several years before severe symptoms develop. Consequently, patients with risk factors for lung cancer are screened earlier than the general public. What concept is the doctor describing to this patient?","The doctor is explaining the concept of **asymptomatic screening** or **early detection**. This concept is rooted in the idea that certain diseases, such as lung cancer, can be more effectively managed and treated if detected early, even before symptoms become apparent. Because lung cancers often do not present with symptoms until they are quite advanced, regular screening for individuals with significant risk factors, such as a heavy smoking history, can identify abnormalities at an earlier, more treatable stage. In this specific case, the patient's 30-pack-year smoking history places him at higher risk for lung cancer, justifying the early use of imaging studies like CT scans for screening purposes. The aim is to catch the cancer early, ideally leading to better outcomes and potentially curative treatment.",Latent period,No
9,"An American Indian/Alaska Native woman comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. She reports cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. She claims that this is her 5th episode within the past year and is concerned if “there’s something else going on.” Her medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with her albuterol inhaler. Her laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39%
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient’s presentation of recurrent sinopulmonary infections, combined with the laboratory findings of significantly decreased levels of immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, and IgM) points towards a diagnosis of **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**.

CVID is characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins and an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The usual onset can be in childhood or adulthood and patients often present with recurrent infections due to their body's inability to effectively produce antibodies.

Key supportive points for CVID in this case:
- The repeated episodes of respiratory infections (5 episodes in the past year)
- The laboratory findings showing decreased levels of IgA (54 mg/dL), IgG (470 mg/dL), and IgM (29 mg/dL)

CVID often requires evaluation of immunoglobulin levels (total and subclasses), and can be further confirmed by assessing the response to vaccines and excluding other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia. Management typically includes immunoglobulin replacement therapy and monitoring for associated complications.

Thus, given the clinical history and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"A White woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. She feels like she cannot fully empty her bowels. She has no history of serious illness. She has a high-fiber diet. Her father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. She appears well. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Crohn's disease. 

Several factors point toward this diagnosis:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has experienced lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, and significant weight loss over a period of 4 months. She also reports a sensation of incomplete evacuation of the bowels.

2. **Physical Examination**: Mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound is indicative of potential inflammation in that area.

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Mild anemia (hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL)
   - Leukocytosis (leukocyte count of 12,000 mm3)
   - Thrombocytosis (platelet count of 480,000 mm3)
   - Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR of 129 mm/h), suggesting significant inflammation.

4. **Imaging**: The barium enema showing ulceration and narrowing of the right colon supports the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, as this condition often involves the terminal ileum and can cause strictures and ulcerations.

5. **Family History**: The patient's father being of Ashkenazi Jewish descent is relevant because this population has a higher incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease.

Crohn's disease is a type of IBD that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract but is most commonly found in the terminal ileum and the colon. The described symptoms and findings are consistent with this chronic inflammatory condition.",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, an Asian man is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm3 in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","**C. Enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube**.

In critically ill patients, particularly those admitted to the ICU, early enteral nutrition is generally preferred over parenteral nutrition, unless there are specific contraindications such as a non-functioning gastrointestinal tract.

Here's a detailed rationale:

1. **Enteral Nutrition (EN)**: Enteral nutrition, which involves feeding through a tube placed in the stomach or small intestine, is associated with fewer complications than parenteral nutrition (PN) and is preferred because it helps maintain gut integrity, reduces the risk of infections, and is more physiological.

2. **Timing**: Early enteral nutrition, ideally within the first 24-48 hours of ICU admission, is recommended for critically ill patients who are unable to eat orally. This approach is associated with improved outcomes such as reduced infectious complications and shorter ICU stays.

3. **Route**: A nasogastric tube is often the method chosen for early enteral nutrition, as it is relatively easy to place and use. It allows for the administration of nutrition directly into the stomach, which is beneficial for patients who cannot take oral nutrition.

4. **Patient's Condition**: This patient, having undergone surgery for an epidural hemorrhage, is now stable postoperatively and on a ventilator. Given the stability of his hemodynamics and the absence of any contraindications for enteral feeding (such as severe gastrointestinal dysfunction or risk of aspiration due to low consciousness), starting enteral nutrition is appropriate.

**Intravenous fluids**: Maintaining intravenous fluids for hydration and electrolytes is necessary, but it does not provide adequate nutrition.

**Summary**: Given the patient’s current condition and the benefits of early enteral nutrition, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutritional needs is to initiate enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"An Asian boy with developmental delays presents to his pediatrician’s office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of his knees, elbows, and around his eyelids. The patient’s mother notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since he was an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of his skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in his sweat and urine. Based on his symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the body. The key clinical features of untreated PKU can include developmental delays, hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, eczema (which may explain the itchy rash), and a musty odor in the sweat and urine.

The most appropriate dietary recommendation for a patient with PKU is to follow a low-phenylalanine diet. This typically involves:

1. **Avoidance of high-protein foods**: High-protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, nuts, and certain beans are high in phenylalanine and should be avoided or severely restricted.
2. **Specialized medical formulas**: These formulas are designed to provide necessary nutrients with minimal phenylalanine.
3. **Low-protein foods**: Specially manufactured low-protein products and foods that are naturally low in protein (such as fruits and vegetables) are recommended.

Implementing these dietary changes can help manage the levels of phenylalanine in the body and prevent the neurologic and developmental issues associated with PKU.

So, the most appropriate dietary recommendation is a low-phenylalanine diet with the use of specialized medical formulas designed for individuals with PKU.",Avoid meat,Yes
13,A White man presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. He has had hypertension for 20 years and is currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. His blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"The most likely reason for the changes observed in the left ventricle in a patient with a long-standing history (20 years) of hypertension and currently elevated blood pressure (150/100 mm Hg) is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). 

Hypertension causes the heart to work harder than normal to pump blood against increased resistance. Over time, this increased workload leads to thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping blood to the rest of the body. This adaptation, while initially beneficial to maintain cardiac output, can eventually lead to reduced cardiac efficiency and other complications.

Echocardiography is a common diagnostic tool used to assess such structural changes in the heart. An echocardiographic finding of left ventricular hypertrophy would be expected in this clinical scenario, given the long-standing hypertension and the current evidence of elevated blood pressure. LVH is a common consequence in chronic hypertension patients and can serve as an indicator of the severity of their hypertensive condition and overall cardiovascular risk.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"An Asian construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of his skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. He also complains of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. He is a smoker, but recently has grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis?","The clinical presentation and laboratory findings indicate that the patient is suffering from acute hepatitis A, as evidenced by the positive Anti-HAV IgM test. Hepatitis A is a viral infection that typically affects the liver, causing symptoms such as jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes), nausea, and loss of appetite, which are consistent with the patient's complaints. The other hepatitis viral panels are negative, which helps to exclude hepatitis B, C, D, and E as potential causes.

The most common mode of transmission for hepatitis A is the **fecal-oral route**. This can occur through:

1. **Ingestion of contaminated food or water**: Hepatitis A is often transmitted when people consume food or water that has been contaminated by feces from an infected person. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices can facilitate the spread of the virus.
  
2. **Close person-to-person contact**: This can include household contact with an infected person, sexual contact (especially among men who have sex with men), or contact in facilities such as daycare centers where hygiene practices may not be adequate.

Given that the patient is an Asian construction worker, it is possible that he might have been exposed to the virus through contaminated food or water, particularly if working in environments where sanitation practices are not stringent.

To summarize, the most common mode of transmission for the patient's diagnosis of hepatitis A is through the **fecal-oral route**, typically involving ingestion of contaminated food or water.",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"A Black/African American boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is homeschooled and the mother is concerned about her son’s development. He is only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and has been “behind on his alphabet."" He always seems to be disinterested and ""just seems to be behind.” The patient is observed to be focused on playing with his cars during the interview. Physical examination demonstrate a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The clinical presentation given is suggestive of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability. The patient’s developmental delay, poor eye contact, and certain physical features—such as a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilaterally enlarged testicles (macroorchidism)—are characteristic of this condition. 

The most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings involves a genetic mutation in the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome. Specifically, this condition is due to an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. In individuals with Fragile X syndrome, the CGG repeat is typically expanded to more than 200 repeats, leading to hypermethylation of the FMR1 gene and subsequent silencing of the gene. This results in a deficiency of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which plays a critical role in synaptic function and plasticity. The deficiency of FMRP disrupts normal neural development and function, accounting for the intellectual and developmental issues observed in Fragile X syndrome.

In summary, the most likely mechanism underlying this patient’s findings is the expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome, leading to gene silencing and reduced levels of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"A Black/African American man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. He has had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. He has gastritis as well as advanced Parkinson disease and currently lives in an assisted-living community. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. He has a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but has not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. His temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), he is tachycardic and tachypneic and his oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm^3
Platelet count 210,000/mm^3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
An x-ray of the chest shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?","This patient presents with a number of concerning symptoms and clinical findings indicative of a serious respiratory infection. The most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms is **his advanced Parkinson disease**. 

Parkinson disease can significantly affect swallowing and lead to dysphagia, which increases the risk of aspiration. Aspiration can result in the inhalation of oropharyngeal contents, leading to aspiration pneumonia. This patient's productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, fever, leukocytosis, and an infiltrate on the chest x-ray in the right upper lobe are all consistent with aspiration pneumonia.

Other factors also contribute to the risk, such as:
- His history of prolonged smoking could have compromised his lung health.
- His history of alcohol abuse could have resulted in an impaired immune system and increased propensity for respiratory infections, although he quit 5 years ago.
- Living in an assisted-living community might increase his exposure to pathogens.

However, the advanced Parkinson disease is the most significant as it directly contributes to aspiration risk, which aligns well with the location of the infiltrate (right upper lobe - common for aspiration pneumonias) and the nature of the patient's symptoms.","Parkinson disease

17,A man of American Indian/Alaska Native race is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this patient?,"Based on the description, the nerve likely damaged is the median nerve. The median nerve runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles in the forearm. Damage to this nerve typically leads to sensory deficits in specific areas of the hand.

The median nerve provides sensation to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger, as well as the distal dorsal aspects of these fingers (the parts on the back of the hand closest to the fingertips).

Therefore, loss of sensation over the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger is most likely in this patient.",Fingertip of the index finger,No
18,"A Black/African American man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, he received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. His blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; his vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration?","The patient is a Black/African American man with a history of kidney transplantation who presents with progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite over 4 months. He is on immunosuppressive medications, including sirolimus and mycophenolate. His laboratory results show normocytic, normochromic anemia and elevated serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL, with previously normal lab values 6 months ago.

Given these findings, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increased creatinine concentration is chronic allograft nephropathy. This condition is a form of chronic rejection and is a leading cause of declining renal function in transplant recipients after the initial post-transplant period. It can lead to progressive fibrosis and scarring of the transplanted kidney, eventually resulting in elevated creatinine levels and other signs of kidney dysfunction.

Key points supporting this diagnosis include:
1. **Time since Transplantation**: The patient is 5 years post-transplant, which is a typical timeframe for chronic allograft nephropathy to develop.
2. **Progressive Symptoms**: The patient’s progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite are consistent with declining kidney function.
3. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Increased blood pressure can be both a cause and a consequence of declining kidney function.
4. **Normocytic, Normochromic Anemia**: This type of anemia is often associated with chronic kidney disease due to decreased erythropoietin production by the damaged kidneys.
5. **Elevated Serum Creatinine**: A significant rise in serum creatinine indicates reduced glomerular filtration rate and impaired kidney function.

Other potential causes, such as medication toxicity or recurrent disease, are also considerations, but the overall clinical picture is most consistent with chronic allograft nephropathy given the long-term post-transplant status and gradual deterioration of kidney function.

Thus, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increased creatinine concentration is chronic allograft nephropathy.",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,No
19,"A White female with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, she is started on high-dose folate supplementation, and her follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. She is at risk for which long-term complication?","This patient is at risk for long-term complication of Vitamin B12 deficiency, which can result in neurological problems.

Individuals who have undergone gastric sleeve operations for morbid obesity are at increased risk for nutrient deficiencies, including vitamin B12 and folate, due to the reduced capacity for nutrient absorption. Although folate deficiency was initially suspected and treated in this patient, leading to improvement in her hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), the normalization of her MCV suggests that she may also have a concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, similar to folate deficiency, but it also has the unique potential to cause neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy, memory loss, and possibly even severe irreversible neurological damage if not treated appropriately.

It is crucial to monitor and manage both folate and vitamin B12 levels in patients with history of bariatric surgery to prevent long-term complications. Thus, this patient should undergo evaluation for vitamin B12 deficiency and, if found deficient, be treated to prevent potential neurological damage.",Peripheral neuropathy,Yes
