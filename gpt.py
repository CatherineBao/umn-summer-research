"""
TODO this week (and next Monday):
- Implement parallel computing: DONE
- Edit system prompt to return only the best answer to the question: DONE
- Give GPT three classes to sort response accuracy into (accurate, relevant, not accurate): DONE
- Generate classifier accuracy statistics:
- Generate response accuracy statistics for each factor introduced: 
- Generate tone specific (general public, etc.) prompts and record accuracy:

TODO when have time:
- Edit system prompt again to return only the top three best answers to the question: 
- See if I can reorganize code to make functions calls run faster: 
- Add function comments:
