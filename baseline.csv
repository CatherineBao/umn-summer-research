0,"During a humanitarian mission to southeast Asia, an individual is brought to the outpatient clinic for a long history (greater than 2 years) of progressive, painless, enlargement of their scrotum. The family history is negative for malignancies and inheritable diseases. The personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking (up to 2 packs per day for the last 20 years) and several medical consultations for episodic fever that resolved spontaneously. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for an enlarged left hemiscrotum that transilluminates. Which of the following accounts for the underlying mechanism in this condition?","The scenario described suggests that the individual may have developed **filariasis**, specifically **lymphatic filariasis** caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or Brugia timori. This is supported by the history of progressive, painless enlargement of the scrotum over a period of more than two years and the positive transillumination test, which indicates hydrocele (fluid-filled sac around a testicle).

The underlying mechanism of this condition is as follows:

### Interruption of lymphatic drainage
- **Lymphatic filariasis** is caused by the parasitic filarial worms which are transmitted to humans through mosquito bites.
- Once inside the human host, the larvae develop into adult worms and reside in the lymphatic system, causing damage and obstruction of the lymphatic vessels.
- The blockage in lymph flow leads to the accumulation of lymphatic fluid, resulting in chronic lymphedema and hydrocele (enlargement of the scrotum).

The episodic fever episodes described in the patient's history may have been acute attacks associated with lymphangitis or filarial fever, which can occur secondary to the ongoing infection.

Thus, the most appropriate underlying mechanism in this condition is **interruption of lymphatic drainage** caused by filarial infection, leading to the observed clinical manifestation of scrotal enlargement and hydrocele.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,Yes
1,"An individual who is recovering in the postpartum unit three days after a Caesarean section is experiencing purulent discharge and continued heavy bleeding. They also report difficulty and discomfort with urination. This person’s surgery was indicated for breech presentation of the infant, and they were at 40 weeks and 2 days gestation at the time of delivery. Their prenatal course was complicated by one episode of pyelonephritis, which was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and suppression nitrofurantoin for the remainder of the pregnancy. The individual has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and atopic dermatitis. On the third postpartum day, their temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 118/71 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Exam reveals that they are uncomfortable and diaphoretic. The lochia is purulent with several blood clots, and the uterus is slightly boggy and soft. There is mild tenderness with uterine manipulation. Which of the following is the best next step in management for this individual's condition?","The clinical presentation of purulent discharge, continued heavy bleeding, fever, tachycardia, and a slightly boggy and soft uterus in a postpartum individual after a Cesarean section is highly suggestive of postpartum endometritis. This condition is a common cause of postpartum fever, particularly following Cesarean delivery. 

Given the symptoms and physical findings:

- Elevated temperature (101.2°F/38.4°C)
- Tachycardia (pulse 112/min)
- Purulent lochia with blood clots
- Boggy and soft uterus with tenderness

The best next step in management is to start **intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics** to treat the endometritis. The typical choice of antibiotics includes:

- Clindamycin plus gentamicin, or
- Ampicillin-sulbactam, or
- Another appropriate combination depending on local antibiograms and patient-specific factors.

Additionally, supportive management involves ensuring adequate hydration and pain control.

One important aspect to remember is that postpartum endometritis occurs more frequently in patients with a history of Cesarean delivery, prolonged labor, prolonged ruptured membranes, or multiple vaginal examinations during labor.

It is also crucial to monitor the patient closely for improvements and any potential complications, including the need for further surgical intervention if there is no response to antibiotics or if the patient’s condition worsens.

In summary, the best next step for this postpartum individual with suspected postpartum endometritis is:

**Initiate intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics.**",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Yes
2,"A previously healthy individual is brought to the emergency department by a companion after briefly losing consciousness. This occurred while moving furniture. The companion mentioned that the patient was unresponsive for a minute but then regained consciousness without confusion. The patient did not experience any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing before or after the episode. They have had episodes of dizziness during exercise at the gym. Blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg while supine and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. Pulse is 70/min while supine and 75/min while standing. Upon examination, there is a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex, both of which disappear with passive leg elevation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","The patient's presentation, which includes a brief loss of consciousness (syncope) while exerting effort, a notable systolic murmur, no significant post-event confusion, and exercise-induced dizziness, suggests the possibility of a structural cardiac condition. Specifically, the most likely cause is **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.

HCM is characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the interventricular septum, which can obstruct blood flow and lead to symptoms like dizziness, syncope, and even sudden cardiac death, especially during exertion. The key points in this case leading to the diagnosis are:

1. **Syncope during exertion**: This is a typical presentation in individuals with HCM due to the outflow obstruction created by the thickened heart muscle.
2. **Murmur characteristics**:
    - The grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and the systolic murmur at the apex both disappearing with passive leg elevation suggest a dynamic and obstructive cause.
3. **Exercise intolerance**: Dizziness at the gym is a common symptom in individuals with HCM, secondary to impaired cardiac output during exercise.
4. **Absence of typical secondary causes**: The patient didn’t report chest pain, palpitations, or significant hemodynamic instability like substantial blood pressure drops with position change, which would suggest other potential causes (e.g., arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension).

Thus, combining these clinical findings, the most likely cause for this patient’s symptoms is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Yes
3,"An individual presents for a checkup at 20 weeks pregnant and has been admitted to the hospital multiple times during the pregnancy for seizures. They have a known seizure disorder but discontinued their valproic acid when they became pregnant. The individual's past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. They do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs. They generally prefer not to take medications and typically see a shaman for their care. Given the recent hospitalization, the individual agrees to start carbamazepine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this individual at this time?","Given the individual's history of seizures and reluctance to take medications, the management of their seizure disorder during pregnancy requires a careful balance between controlling the seizures and minimizing risks to the fetus.

Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug (AED) that can be used in pregnancy, but it is important to note that no AED is completely free of teratogenic risks. Valproic acid, which the patient discontinued, is associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders and is generally avoided in pregnancy.

Here’s the most appropriate approach to manage this individual’s condition:

1. **Initiate Carbamazepine:** Given the patient's agreement, starting carbamazepine is appropriate. This medication is less teratogenic compared to valproic acid. However, it is crucial to monitor both its efficacy and potential side effects.

2. **Folic Acid Supplementation:** Recommend high-dose folic acid supplementation (4-5 mg/day) at least 1 month before conception and during the first trimester to reduce the risk of neural tube defects associated with anticonvulsant use.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor seizure control, potential drug side effects, and serum levels of carbamazepine. Adjust dosage as needed based on therapeutic response and serum drug levels, considering physiological changes during pregnancy that can alter drug metabolism.

4. **Prenatal Care:** Ensure that the individual receives consistent prenatal care, including ultrasound screenings and possible fetal echocardiography, to monitor for congenital anomalies.

5. **Non-pharmacological Support:** Complement the pharmacological treatment with non-pharmacological support and lifestyle modifications that may help reduce seizure triggers. The individual may benefit from counseling on sleep hygiene, stress management, and dietary considerations.

6. **Seizure Action Plan:** Develop a seizure action plan tailored to the individual's needs, including emergency management of seizures if they occur.

Although the individual prefers alternative medicine, ensuring the safety and health of both the mother and the fetus takes precedence. Engaging in open discussions about the importance of medication adherence and potential risks versus benefits can help in making an informed decision regarding their care.

**Note:** The management plan should be individualized, and it may be beneficial to involve a multidisciplinary team, including an obstetrician, neurologist, and possibly a medical genetics specialist, to optimize both maternal and fetal outcomes.",Folate,No
4,"A patient presents to their primary care physician for an annual checkup, stating they feel well and have no complaints. They live alone and work as a banker. They smoke 1 cigarette per day and drink 2 alcoholic beverages per night. They occasionally experience symmetrical pain in their hands with a color change from red to white to blue before returning to normal. Their temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's hypertension is treated, and they return 2 weeks later complaining of weight gain in their legs and arms. On exam, bilateral edema is noted in their extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a few possible differential diagnoses, including complications related to hypertension, potential heart or kidney issues, and possibly a systemic condition, given the bilateral edema. The presence of symmetrical hand pain with color changes also suggests a vascular phenomenon like Raynaud's phenomenon. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Review the current management of hypertension**: Ensure the patient's blood pressure has improved since initiating or adjusting treatment. Poorly controlled hypertension can contribute to edema due to heart failure or kidney-related causes.

2. **Order Laboratory Tests**:
   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for any underlying infection or anemia.
   - **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**: To assess kidney function (creatinine, BUN) and liver function, as well as electrolyte levels.
   - **BNP (B-Type Natriuretic Peptide)**: Elevated BNP levels can indicate heart failure.
   - **Urinalysis**: To check for proteinuria, which can indicate kidney issues.

3. **Imaging Studies**:
   - **Echocardiogram**: To evaluate cardiac function and check for signs of heart failure.
   - **Chest X-ray**: To look for signs of pulmonary congestion secondary to heart failure.

4. **Medical History Review**: Obtain a detailed history focusing on any recent changes in lifestyle, diet, and weight gain patterns, as well as adherence to current medication regimen.

Given the symptoms of bilateral edema, one crucial test would be to check for potential heart failure or kidney dysfunction:

### Best Initial Step
1. **Echocardiogram**: Given the patient’s significant bilateral edema and history of poorly controlled hypertension, an echocardiogram is essential to assess heart function and potential heart failure. An echocardiogram will help evaluate left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, valve abnormalities, and overall cardiac structure and function.

### Subsequent Steps
2. **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**: To assess kidney function (alongside an echocardiogram to check cardiac function) to rule out renal causes of the edema.
3. **Consider referring to a cardiologist**: If the echocardiogram or lab results suggest significant heart dysfunction.

### Immediate Lifestyle Recommendations
- **Counsel the patient on smoking cessation** and reducing alcohol intake, both of which can contribute to cardiovascular issues and potentially exacerbate hypertension.

By focusing on these steps, especially the echocardiogram and CMP, you can better assess the underlying cause of the edema and manage the patient's condition effectively.",Lisinopril,No
5,"An individual comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion. They were diagnosed with systemic sclerosis 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows puffy, taut skin over the fingers. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is no jugular venous distention. An x-ray of the chest shows enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a prominent right heart border. Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right ventricular pressures and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. Treatment with tadalafil is begun. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?","The patient described has systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, and is presenting with signs of pulmonary hypertension. Systemic sclerosis can lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) due to fibrosis and vascular remodeling. The patient's cardiac catheterization results confirm the presence of PAH, evidenced by the elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure.

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor commonly used for the treatment of PAH. The expected beneficial effect of tadalafil in treating PAH is due to its action of increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels within the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels.

Here's the detailed mechanism:

1. **Inhibition of PDE-5:** Tadalafil inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5).
2. **Increased cGMP Levels:** By inhibiting PDE-5, tadalafil prevents the breakdown of cGMP, leading to an increase in cGMP levels.
3. **Smooth Muscle Relaxation:** Elevated levels of cGMP promote relaxation of the smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary arteries.
4. **Vasodilation:** The relaxation of these smooth muscle cells results in vasodilation and reduced pulmonary arterial pressure.
5. **Improvement of Symptoms:** With decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure, there is an improvement in symptoms such as shortness of breath and reduced strain on the right ventricle.

Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of tadalafil is due to its ability to **increase cGMP levels, leading to pulmonary vasodilation**.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,No
6,"An individual is brought to their primary care provider by a parent. They are concerned that the individual's acne is getting worse and may leave scars. They have tried several over-the-counter products without success. The individual is otherwise healthy and without complaint. They were born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The individual is up to date on all vaccines with some delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially in language development. They are having trouble with school and have a history of detentions for misbehavior and acting out. On examination, they stand 6 ft 3 inches tall, considerably taller than either parent or other family members, with inflamed pustular acne on their face, shoulders, and chest. They are otherwise healthy. Which of the following karyotypes is most likely associated with this individual's clinical features?","The clinical features described, including tall stature, acne, difficulties with school performance, and behavioral issues, suggest a potential underlying genetic condition. One possible condition that fits this profile is **47,XYY syndrome**, where the individual has an extra Y chromosome.

**47,XYY syndrome** often presents with the following features:
- Increased height (often much taller than peers and family members)
- Educational difficulties, including issues with language development and learning disabilities
- Behavioral problems, such as impulsivity or difficulty with social interactions

The karyotype for this condition is **47,XYY**.

In summary, the most likely karyotype associated with the clinical features of this individual is **47,XYY**.",47 XYY,Yes
7,"An individual presents to their primary care physician with progressively worsening hearing loss. They state that the trouble with hearing began approximately 7-8 years ago. They are able to hear when someone is speaking to them, but have difficulty understanding what is being said, especially when there is background noise. In addition to the current symptoms, they report a steady ringing in both ears and sometimes experience dizziness. Medical history is significant for three prior episodes of acute otitis media. Family history is notable for a parent being diagnosed with cholesteatoma. The temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 14/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, when a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead, sound is appreciated equally in both ears. When a tuning fork is placed by the external auditory canal and subsequently on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms?","The patient's clinical presentation suggests **presbycusis** (age-related hearing loss). Let's break down the pertinent information:

1. **Progressive Hearing Loss**: The patient mentions progressively worsening hearing over the past 7-8 years, which is typical of presbycusis.

2. **Difficulty Understanding Speech, Especially with Background Noise**: This is a classic symptom of sensorineural hearing loss (associated with aging), where high-frequency sounds are most affected, making understanding speech, particularly in noisy environments, challenging.

3. **Tinnitus**: The steady ringing in both ears is a common symptom associated with presbycusis and sensorineural hearing loss.

4. **Dizziness**: While not exclusively indicative of presbycusis, dizziness can be seen in various types of hearing loss and ear conditions.

5. **Weber Test**: When a tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead, the patient perceives sound equally in both ears, which is consistent with either normal hearing or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. 

6. **Rinne Test**: Air conduction (AC) being greater than bone conduction (BC) in both ears is suggestive of normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss as opposed to conductive hearing loss.

7. **Family history of cholesteatoma**: While having a parent with cholesteatoma can raise suspicion for ear pathology, the symptoms and testing results align more closely with sensorineural deficits. 

Given this evidence:

- **Conductive hearing loss** typically results in a Rinne test where bone conduction is greater than air conduction.
- **Sensorineural hearing loss**, such as presbycusis, results in the Rinne test where air conduction is greater than bone conduction, and the sound is appreciated equally in both ears during the Weber test.

While past acute otitis media and family history of cholesteatoma might initially suggest a conductive pathology, the current clinical signs (progressive hearing loss, especially with speech understanding in noise, bilateral tinnitus, and the described tuning fork test results) strongly favor a diagnosis of presbycusis.

Thus, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is **presbycusis**.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,Yes
8,"An individual presents to the office for their annual physical examination with no current complaints. Past medical history is unremarkable. They report a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is only remarkable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when coughing. A non-contrast CT scan of the chest is performed, and the doctor informs them that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in the upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised by this news since they have never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs them that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease and that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms. This is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened earlier than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this patient?","The concept being described by the doctor to this patient is ""lead time."" 

Lead time refers to the period between the early detection of a disease (often through screening) and the point at which the disease would have been diagnosed because symptoms appeared. In the context of cancer screening, detecting a cancer earlier than it would have been detected based on symptoms provides a ""lead time."" This does not necessarily mean that the patient's survival is improved (as lead-time bias is a concern in interpreting the benefits of screening), but it does give more time to potentially intervene earlier in the disease process.

In this scenario, the doctor is explaining that lung cancer often does not produce symptoms until it is at an advanced stage, and that screening individuals at high risk (such as long-term smokers) can lead to earlier detection, even before symptoms develop, thereby providing lead time.",Latent period,No
9,"A patient comes to the clinic complaining of headache and sinus drainage for the past 13 days. They report cold-like symptoms 2 weeks ago that progressively got worse. The patient endorses subjective fever, congestion, sinus headache, cough, and chills. They claim that this is their 5th episode within the past year and are concerned if “there’s something else going on.” Their medical history is significant for asthma that is adequately controlled with an albuterol inhaler. Their laboratory findings are shown below:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 16.2 g/dL
Hematocrit: 39 %
Leukocyte count: 7,890/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3
IgA: 54 mg/dL (Normal: 76-390 mg/dL)
IgE: 0 IU/mL (Normal: 0-380 IU/mL)
IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of a primary immunodeficiency, specifically Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). Key points supporting this diagnosis include:

1. **Recurrent Infections:** The patient has experienced multiple episodes of sinus infections in the past year, which is common in individuals with CVID.
2. **Low Immunoglobulin Levels:** The laboratory results show significantly reduced levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM. CVID is characterized by reduced serum levels of multiple classes of immunoglobulins.
3. **Normal Differential Count:** While the leukocyte and platelet counts are within normal ranges, the hallmark of CVID is the low immunoglobulin levels rather than abnormalities in these counts.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**. This condition often presents with recurrent bacterial infections due to the inability to properly produce effective antibodies. It can also be associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disorders and gastrointestinal issues, among other complications.

Further evaluation by an immunologist may include more detailed immunologic testing, and treatment often involves immunoglobulin replacement therapy to help manage and prevent further infections.",Common variable immunodeficiency,Yes
10,"A person comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. During this period, they have had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss. They feel like they cannot fully empty their bowels. They have no history of serious illness and maintain a high-fiber diet. Their father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. They appear well. Their temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. A test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Their hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,000 mm3, platelet count is 480,000 mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 129 mm/h. A barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","Given the patient's symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Crohn's disease. 

Several key factors support this diagnosis:
1. **Symptoms**: The patient describes intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, and a sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation.
2. **Weight loss**: A 5-kg weight loss over 4 months.
3. **Family history**: The father's Ashkenazi Jewish descent (a group with a higher incidence of inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease).
4. **Physical findings**: Mild right lower quadrant tenderness on abdominal examination.
5. **Lab findings**: Mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.5 g/dL), leukocytosis (leukocyte count 12,000/mm³), thrombocytosis (platelet count 480,000/mm³), and elevated ESR (129 mm/h), all of which suggest an inflammatory process.
6. **Imaging findings**: Barium enema showing ulceration and narrowing of the right colon, which is typified in Crohn's disease due to the presence of transmural inflammation that can cause strictures and ulcerations.

Other conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, would generally present with continuous colonic involvement starting from the rectum and may not involve the small intestine or show such a focal involvement of the right colon. The absence of macroscopic blood in stool also leans away from ulcerative colitis, which is typically associated with bloody diarrhea.

Therefore, taking into account the constellation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, Crohn's disease is the most likely diagnosis.",Crohn disease,Yes
11,"Three days after being admitted to the hospital because of a fall from the roof of a two-story building, a patient is being monitored in the intensive care unit. On arrival, the patient was somnolent and not oriented to person, place, or time. A CT scan of the head showed an epidural hemorrhage that was 45 cm³ in size and a midline shift of 7 mm. Emergency surgery was performed with craniotomy and hematoma evacuation on the day of admission. Perioperatively, a bleeding vessel was identified and ligated. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator. The temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 117/78 mm Hg. The ventilator is set at a FiO2 of 55%, tidal volume of 520 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.0 cm H2O. In addition to intravenous administration of fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition?","The most appropriate next step in managing this patient's nutrition is to begin **enteral feeding (tube feeding)** as soon as the patient is hemodynamically stable and gastrointestinal function is deemed adequate.

Here’s why:

1. **Gut Function and Integrity**: Enteral feeding helps maintain the integrity of the gut mucosa, which is critical in preventing infections and other complications that can arise from gut atrophy or translocation of bacteria.

2. **Reduced Complications**: Enteral nutrition is associated with a lower risk of infection and other complications compared to parenteral nutrition.

3. **Early Nutrition**: Starting nutrition early in critically ill patients is shown to improve outcomes. It supports metabolic needs, promotes healing, and can prevent malnutrition.

### Specific Steps:

- **Assess Gastrointestinal Function**: Ensure the patient does not have contraindications to enteral feeding, such as active gastrointestinal bleeding, severe ischemia, or high-output fistula.

- **Select the Feeding Route**: Typically, nasogastric or orogastric tubes are used if the patient does not already have a feeding tube in place. For patients with longer-term needs, consider a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

- **Start Slowly**: Initiate enteral feeds at a low rate and gradually increase as tolerance is assessed.

### Ongoing Considerations:

- **Monitor Tolerance and Complications**: Watch for signs of gastrointestinal intolerance, such as high gastric residuals, vomiting, distention, or diarrhea.

- **Nutritional Requirements**: Customize the feeding solutions based on the patient’s nutritional needs, including caloric goals, protein requirements, and electrolytes.

- **Blood Glucose Control**: Ensure glucose levels are monitored and managed, as stress-induced hyperglycemia is common in critically ill patients.

In summary, for this patient with a stabilized condition after a significant injury and surgery, implementing an enteral nutrition plan is the most appropriate next step as it supports recovery and reduces the risk of complications associated with malnutrition and gut permeability.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Yes
12,"An individual with developmental delays presents to a healthcare provider's office with an ‘itchy rash’ on the flexor surfaces of their knees, elbows, and around their eyelids. A caregiver notes that the rashes have had a relapsing-remitting course since infancy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows hypopigmentation of the individual's skin and hair, as well as a musty odor in their sweat and urine. Based on the individual’s symptoms and history, which of the following is the most appropriate dietary recommendation?","The presentation described is suggestive of Phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. Key clinical features that align with PKU include developmental delays, hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, a musty odor in sweat and urine, and eczema-like rashes.

The most appropriate dietary recommendation for managing PKU is **a diet low in phenylalanine** to prevent the buildup of this amino acid in the body:

1. **Avoid high-phenylalanine foods**: Foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, nuts, soy products, and certain grains (like wheat and rice) are typically restricted.
2. **Special phenylalanine-free medical formula**: Individuals with PKU often require special medical formula that supplies essential nutrients without phenylalanine.
3. **Frequent monitoring**: Blood levels of phenylalanine are regularly monitored to ensure they remain within a safe range.
4. **Lofenalac products**: These are specialized low-phenylalanine foods that are often used in the dietary management of PKU.

Therefore, based on the symptoms and history provided, **a diet low in phenylalanine** is the most appropriate dietary recommendation for this individual.",Avoid meat,Yes
13,An individual presented to a medical clinic for a routine follow-up. They have had hypertension for 20 years and are currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications. Their blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examinations were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed some changes in the left ventricle. What is the most likely reason for the change?,"Given the patient's long history of hypertension and the presence of some observed changes in the left ventricle on echocardiography, the most likely reason for these changes is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). 

Chronic hypertension imposes increased workload on the heart, particularly the left ventricle, as it has to pump against the elevated systemic arterial pressure. Over time, this leads to adaptive changes in the myocardial structure, most notably hypertrophy of the ventricular walls. LVH is a common consequence of prolonged hypertension and serves as a compensatory mechanism designed to maintain cardiac output despite elevated afterload.

Left ventricular hypertrophy can be identified on echocardiography by measuring the thickness of the ventricular walls and the size of the ventricular chamber. Key signs of LVH on an echocardiogram include increased mass of the left ventricular myocardium and potentially altered diastolic and systolic function.

Management of LVH typically involves better control of blood pressure to prevent further progression and mitigate risks of associated complications like heart failure, arrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease. This might involve adjusting the current anti-hypertensive regimen or optimizing lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and salt intake.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Yes
14,"A construction worker presents to the office due to a yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes for the past 2 weeks. The individual also complains of nausea and loss of appetite for the same duration. The past medical history is insignificant. The individual is a smoker but recently has grown a distaste for smoking. The vital signs include: heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 111/74 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is mild hepatomegaly. The results of the hepatitis viral panel are as follows:
Anti-HAV IgM positive
HBsAg negative
IgM anti-HBc negative
Anti-HCV negative
HCV-RNA negative
Anti-HDV negative
Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this diagnosis?","The construction worker's symptoms and viral profile are indicative of an acute hepatitis A infection, as evidenced by the positive Anti-HAV IgM. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is typically transmitted via the fecal-oral route. This mode of transmission is most commonly associated with:

1. **Consumption of contaminated food or water**: Often due to improper handling or inadequate sanitation.
2. **Ingestion of raw or undercooked food**: Especially shellfish that has been harvested from contaminated water.
3. **Close personal contact**: Such as household or sexual contact with an infected person.

Given the nature of the construction worker's occupation, it's possible that poor sanitary conditions at work or consumption of contaminated food or water could have led to the infection. Emphasizing safe hygiene practices and ensuring access to clean water and proper sanitary facilities could help prevent such infections.",Fecal-oral,Yes
15,"An individual is brought to the clinic by a guardian for an annual check-up. The family recently moved from Nebraska and is hoping to establish care. The patient is homeschooled, and the guardian is concerned about the individual's development. They are only able to say 2 to 3 word sentences and have been “behind on their alphabet."" They always seem disinterested and ""just seem to be behind.” The patient is observed to be focused on playing with toys during the interview. Physical examination demonstrates a well-nourished child with poor eye contact, a prominent jaw, a single palmar crease, and bilateral physical characteristics of note. What is the most likely mechanism of this patient’s findings?","The combination of developmental delays, poor eye contact, prominent jaw, single palmar crease, and other physical characteristics suggests the possibility of a genetic condition. The most likely mechanism behind this patient's findings could be related to a genetic disorder, such as Fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. It is characterized by a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Physical features can include a long face, large ears, a prominent jaw, and a single palmar crease. Affected individuals often have difficulty with communication and social interaction, which could explain the limited speech and disinterest noted by the guardian.

The underlying mechanism of Fragile X syndrome is a mutation on the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. This gene contains a segment of DNA that is repeated (called a CGG repeat). Normally, this segment is repeated 5-44 times, but in individuals with Fragile X syndrome, it can be repeated over 200 times, leading to a ""full mutation."" This causes a deficiency or absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is vital for normal neural development.

The behavioral and physical findings described, coupled with the identified characteristic features such as a prominent jaw and single palmar crease, strongly support the likelihood of this genetic etiology. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient for genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Genetic counseling for the family would also be beneficial.",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Yes
16,"An individual is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. They have had a productive cough with foul-smelling sputum for 1 week. The individual has gastritis and advanced Parkinson disease and currently resides in an assisted-living community. They smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 5 years ago. They have a 30-year history of alcohol abuse but have not consumed any alcohol in the past 5 years. Their temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), they are tachycardic and tachypneic, and their oxygen saturation is 77% on room air. Auscultation of the lung shows rales and decreased breath sounds over the right upper lung field. Examination shows a resting tremor. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 17,000/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Lactic acid 4.1 mmol/L (N=0.5–1.5)
A chest x-ray shows infiltrates in the right upper lobe. Which of the following is the most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms?","The most significant predisposing factor for this patient's respiratory symptoms is their history of advanced Parkinson disease.

This patient presents with symptoms indicative of a lung infection, specifically an aspiration pneumonia, given the productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, signs of infection (fever, elevated leukocyte count), and a lung infiltrate on chest x-ray. The advanced Parkinson disease is a critical predisposing factor for aspiration pneumonia. Parkinson disease affects the muscles involved in swallowing and the coordination of protective mechanisms against aspiration, increasing the risk of food, liquid, or secretions being aspirated into the lungs.

Here is the reasoning process:

1. **Advanced Parkinson Disease**:
   - Neurological conditions like Parkinson disease can impair the swallowing reflex and esophageal motility, leading to a higher risk of aspiration. Aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents can result in pneumonia, especially common in individuals with dysphagia.
  
2. **History of Alcohol Abuse**:
   - Chronic alcohol use can lead to an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia, but the patient has abstained from alcohol for the past 5 years.

3. **Smoking History**:
   - A long history of smoking can impair lung function and immune response, contributing to lung pathology, yet the likely acute cause here is aspiration given the nature of the symptoms and the patient's other conditions.

4. **Living in Assisted-living Community**:
   - This increases the risk of exposure to respiratory pathogens, yet aspiration risk due to neuromuscular impairment is more critical for pneumonia given the current presentation.

Overall, the most significant predisposing factor for this patient’s respiratory symptoms is the advanced Parkinson disease, which likely contributed to an aspiration event leading to aspiration pneumonia.","Parkinson disease

17,An individual is brought to the emergency department after being attacked with a knife. Physical examination shows a 4-cm laceration in the midline of the right forearm. An MRI of the right arm shows damage to a nerve that runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles. Loss of sensation over which of the following areas is most likely in this individual?,"In the scenario provided, the nerve affected is likely the **median nerve**, as it runs between the superficial and deep flexor digitorum muscles in the forearm.

Damage to the median nerve in the forearm can result in sensory loss over specific regions of the hand. The median nerve supplies sensation to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger, as well as the corresponding areas of the dorsal aspect of these fingers (particularly the distal phalanx regions).

Therefore, in this individual, you would most likely observe **loss of sensation over the palmar aspects of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger**.",Fingertip of the index finger,No
18,"An individual comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, they received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. Blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; their vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's increase in creatinine concentration?","The scenario describes a patient with a history of a kidney transplant who is currently exhibiting progressively worsening fatigue, loss of appetite, and new-onset hypertension, as well as laboratory findings of normocytic normochromic anemia and elevated serum creatinine.

Given the patient's use of sirolimus and mycophenolate, and the current findings, the most likely underlying mechanism for the increase in creatinine concentration is **renal allograft rejection**. 

Renal allograft rejection typically presents with an increase in serum creatinine, hypertension, and possibly anemia. The normal laboratory and vital signs reported 6 months ago, followed by the recent deterioration, further support this diagnosis.

To summarize, the patient's elevated serum creatinine concentration is most likely due to **chronic allograft nephropathy**, a form of chronic rejection, which is characterized by:
- Gradual deterioration in kidney function
- Increased serum creatinine
- Proteinuria (not directly mentioned but often present)
- Hypertension
- Normocytic anemia (likely due to decreased erythropoietin production by the damaged kidney)

Management involves a combination of monitoring renal function, potential adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy, and addressing secondary complications such as hypertension and anemia.

19,"An individual with a past medical history of a gastric sleeve operation for morbid obesity presents for pre-surgical clearance prior to a knee arthroplasty. Work-up reveals a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 26.1%, and MCV of 106 fL. With concern for folate deficiency, they are started on high dose folate supplementation, and their follow-up labs are as follows: hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and MCV of 96 fL. They are at risk for which long-term complication?","The individual in question is at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency as a long-term complication. Here’s a detailed explanation of why this might be the case:

1. **Gastric Sleeve Operation**: This type of surgery can lead to reduced absorption of certain nutrients, including vitamin B12 and folate, due to the decreased stomach size and altered gastrointestinal anatomy.

2. **Initial Lab Findings**: The elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 106 fL suggests a macrocytic anemia, commonly associated with deficiencies in either folate or vitamin B12. The low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels further confirm the presence of anemia.

3. **Response to Folate Supplementation**: Upon initiating high-dose folate supplementation, there is an improvement in the hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCV levels (MCV normalizes to 96 fL, hemoglobin increases to 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit to 28.5%). This suggests that the patient had a component of folate deficiency contributing to their anemia.

4. **Potential Masking of B12 Deficiency**: Folate supplementation can improve hematologic parameters (like hemoglobin and MCV) even if the patient has a concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency. However, it does not address the neurological aspects of B12 deficiency. Thus, while folate correction might normalize the blood picture, a hidden B12 deficiency may persist.

5. **Neurological Risks**: Vitamin B12 deficiency, if left untreated, can lead to serious neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, and cognitive disturbances. These neurological issues can be irreversible if not treated promptly.

Given these points, it is crucial to monitor this patient for signs of vitamin B12 deficiency and to consider regular screening for B12 levels, especially since the initial presentation and improvement upon folate supplementation can mask an underlying B12 deficiency. If B12 deficiency is detected, appropriate supplementation should be instituted to prevent long-term complications.",Peripheral neuropathy,Yes
